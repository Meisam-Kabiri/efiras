It is worth mentioning that the \ndistribution of the IFM\u2019s profits is not considered as a charge and cannot therefore be deducted. \n32. \nThe CSSF would like to indicate that the fees paid by the IFM and which correspond to the \nremuneration for the services provided by delegates on behalf of the managed UCIs are not \nconsidered as fixed overheads within the meaning of Article 97 of the CRR and may thus be \ndeducted. \n33. \nWithin the limits of the provisions of Article 102(1)(a) of the 2010 Law and Article 8(6) of the 2013 \nLaw, an IFM does not have to provide up to 50% of additional own funds calculated according to the \nvalue of the managed portfolios exceeding EUR 250 million, if it benefits from a guarantee of the \nsame amount given by a credit institution or an insurance undertaking which has its registered office \nin a Member State, or in a third country where it is subject to prudential rules considered by the CSSF \nas equivalent to those laid down in EU law. \n34. \nThe provision or withdrawal of such a guarantee as well as any change regarding the conditions of \nthis guarantee must be notified beforehand to the CSSF. \n35. \nIrrespective of the above, the IFM which is also authorised to provide the services referred to in \nArticle 101(3) of the 2010 Law and/or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law must, in addition, comply with \nthe Luxembourg regulations transposing Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 regarding capital \nadequacy. \n\n--- Page 15 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 15/96 \n36.\nThe CSSF publishes on its website4 details on the methods for calculating the required own funds of\nIFMs. \nSpecific provisions applicable to AIFMs: \n37. \nTo cover potential professional liability risks resulting from the activities the AIFM may carry out \npursuant to the 2013 Law, the AIFM and the FIAAG must either: \n\u2022 \nhave additional own funds which are appropriate to cover potential liability risks arising \nfrom professional negligence; or \n\u2022 \nhold a professional indemnity insurance against liability arising from professional \nnegligence which is appropriate to the risks covered. \nTo this end, every AIFM and every FIAAG must comply with the provisions laid down in Articles \n12 to 15 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \n38. \nThe AIFM which decided to cover the liability risks arising from professional negligence through \nadditional own funds must have an additional amount of own funds of at least 0.01% of the value of \nthe portfolios of managed AIFs. Where an AIF invests in other AIFs managed by the same external \nmanager, this investment cannot be excluded from the calculation of assets under management of the \nIFM for the purposes of calculating the additional own funds requirements referred to in this point. \n39. \nThe AIFM which has a professional indemnity insurance in accordance with the provisions of Article \n15 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 must notify the CSSF, as soon as it has knowledge \nthereof, of any changes in the insurance policy, particularly with respect to the amount of the defined \nexcess and the covered amounts as referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 15 of Delegated \nRegulation (EU) 231/2013.",

This requirement implies that the IFM cannot only have a \ncorporate or registered office in Luxembourg. \n116.

The central administration of the IFM, which comprises in a broad sense the functions of direction \nand management, of execution and of control, must permit the IFM to have control of all its activities. \n118. The concept of \u201cdecision-making centre\u201d does not only include the activity of the senior management \npursuant to Article 102(1)(c) of the 2010 Law and Article 7(1)(c) of the 2013 Law but also the \nactivities of the persons responsible for the different key functions or of any other business unit within \nthe IFM. \n119.

To that effect, the IFM must have in \nLuxembourg the human and technical resources necessary and sufficient to exercise the activities it \nintends to exercise and in order to monitor the delegated functions. This implies that it has the \nfollowing elements (non-exhaustive list) in place in Luxembourg: \n\u2022 \nenough own competent operating staff in order to execute the decisions taken (Section \n5.1.1.: Clarifications on human resources); \n\u2022 \nits own systems of execution, i.e. procedures and technical and IT infrastructures \n(Section 5.1.2. : Clarifications on technical infrastructure, IT and business continuity); \n\u2022 \nan accounting function (Section 5.1.3.: Clarifications on the accounting function); \n\u2022 \nits own premises (Section 5.1.4: Clarifications on the premises in Luxembourg). \n120.

The staff must have appropriate individual and collective professional skills having regard to the \ninvestment strategies of the managed UCIs. \n\n--- Page 25 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 25/96 \n123.\nEvery IFM must employ at least three full-time people (FTE) at the head office in Luxembourg who\nperform key functions. Depending on the nature and complexity of its activity, the IFM must adapt \nthe size of the teams performing key functions and employ more people with the necessary skills, \nknowledge and expertise in order to perform key functions. \n124. Long-term absences or departures of staff members (for example, resignations or dismissals) cannot \nimpair the proper functioning of the IFM in the long run. \n125. In the absence of a staff member in charge of key functions, it is necessary to arrange that a staff \nmember with appropriate experience and necessary independence replaces him/her if need be. \n126. The staff are, in principle, employed by the IFM with which it is bound by an employment contract. \n127. The CSSF may grant derogation from the requirements referred to in point 126 and authorise part of \nthe staff to be seconded or made available by an entity belonging to the same group or by a third-\nparty company. In this case, the contract governing this secondment or this availability must be \nsubmitted to the CSSF for prior approval. Furthermore, the contract must contain rules for managing \nconflicts of interest between the relevant staff and the entity to which the staff also provide services. \nThis contract must also specify the tasks of the relevant staff, the reporting line with the conducting \nofficers of the IFM for the functions performed in the entity pursuant to Articles 5(1)(a) of CSSF \nRegulation 10-4 and 57(1)(a) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 as well as actual time spent \nwithin the IFM. The staff thus made available to the IFM or seconded must be permanently located \nin Luxembourg and must be reachable at any time in Luxembourg during normal business hours. \nThis does not however prevent the staff members from having their domicile in a place allowing \nthem, in principle, to come to Luxembourg every day. \n128. Where, due to the small size of the IFM, several duties and responsibilities have to be assigned to the \nsame person, this grouping must be organised so that it does not prejudice the objective pursued by \nthe segregation of duties. \n129. Specific provision applicable to ManCos: The performance of multiple functions by the same person \nshould not prevent or be likely to prevent this same person from discharging any particular function\nsoundly, honestly and professionally in accordance with Article 6(3) of CSSF Regulation 10-4. \n130. Specific recommendation to AIFMs: It is recommended that the AIFM also complies with the \nprovision referred to in point 129 above. \n131. The organisation chart of the IFM must detail the various (operational and control) functions of the \nstructure and the reporting and functional links between these functions and between the senior \nmanagement and management body/governing body of the IFM. \n132. The organisation chart and description of the duties must be established based on the principle of \nsegregation of duties. Pursuant to this principle, the duties and responsibilities must be assigned so \nas to avoid that they are incompatible for the same person. The objective pursued is to avoid conflicts \nof interest and to prevent, through a peer review environment, a person from making mistakes and \nirregularities. \n133. Upon the CSSF\u2019s request, the IFM must provide an updated organisation chart. To this end, the \norganisation chart must, in particular, include: \n\u2022 \nthe name of the members of the management body/governing body, the conducting \nofficers and the persons responsible for key functions; \n\u2022 \nthe number of staff assigned to each department or unit of the IFM, drawing a distinction \nin particular between the functions of portfolio management, administration of UCIs, \nmarketing, risk management, compliance, internal audit as well as between the persons \nin charge of AML/CFT and those responsible for monitoring the delegates. \n\n--- Page 26 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 26/96",

As a general rule, the IFM must have its own computers and \nappropriate and duly documented computer programmes in its premises in Luxembourg. \n137.

The second line consists of the permanent risk management (Section 5.3.1.) and compliance (Section \n5.3.2.) functions which contribute to the independent risk control, as well as of the support functions, \nincluding the IT function (Section 5.1.2.) and accounting function (Section 5.1.3.). \n157.

Internal control functions); \n\u2022 \ninternal reporting requirements; \n\u2022 \npersonal transactions; \n\u2022 \nmanagement of conflicts of interest; \n\u2022 \nexercise of voting rights; \n\u2022 \nrules of conduct; \n\u2022 \nremuneration policy. \n160. In practice, the internal governance arrangements must include in particular: \n\u2022 \na clear and consistent organisational and operational structure including decision-\nmaking powers, reporting and functional links and segregation of duties which are \nclearly defined, transparent, consistent, complete and free from conflicts of interest; \n\u2022 \nadequate internal control mechanisms; \n\u2022 \na formal escalation, settlement and, where appropriate, sanction procedure for the \nproblems, shortcomings and irregularities identified through the internal control \nmechanisms; \n\u2022 \ninternal communication arrangements including an internal whistleblowing procedure \nwhich enables the staff of the IFM to draw the attention of those responsible to all their \nsignificant and legitimate concerns related to the internal governance of the IFM; \n\u2022 \nbusiness continuity management arrangements aimed to limit the risks of serious \ndisruption of business activities and to maintain the key operations as defined by the \nmanagement body/governing body upon proposal of the senior management. These \narrangements must include a business continuity plan which describes the actions to be \nput in place in order to continue to operate in case of an incident or disaster; \n\u2022 \ncrisis management arrangements which ensure appropriate responsiveness in case of \ncrisis, including a business recovery plan. \n161. Every IFM promotes an internal control and risk culture which aims to ensure that all members of \nstaff actively take part in the detection, reporting and control of risks incurred by the IFM.",

In accordance with CSSF Regulation 10-4 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013, every IFM \nmust establish and maintain operational a permanent compliance, risk management and internal audit \nfunction. \n\n--- Page 29 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 29/96 \n163.\nThe policies implemented with respect to risk management, compliance and audit must provide for\nthree distinct internal control functions: on the one hand, the risk control function and compliance \nfunction which are part of the second line of defence and on the other hand, the internal audit function \nwhich is part of the third line of defence. These policies which describe the fields of intervention \ndirectly related to each internal control function must clearly define the responsibilities for the \ncommon fields of intervention and the objectives as well as the independence, objectivity and \npermanence of the internal control functions. \n164. Each internal control function must be under the responsibility of a separate function manager who \nis appointed and revoked in accordance with an internal written procedure. The appointments and \nrevocations of the persons responsible for the internal control functions must be approved by the \nmanagement body/governing body and communicated to the CSSF in writing, in accordance with \nthe provisions laid down in Sub-section 5.3.1.3. for the risk management function, Sub-section \n5.3.2.4. for the compliance function and Sub-section 5.3.3.4. for the internal audit function. \n165. The persons responsible for the three internal control functions are accountable to the senior \nmanagement and ultimately to the management body/governing body for the performance of their \nmandate. In this respect, these persons must be able to contact and inform, directly and on their own \ninitiative, the management body/governing body or, where appropriate, the members of the audit \ncommittee as well as the CSSF. \n166. The main purpose of the internal control functions is to verify compliance with all the internal \npolicies and procedures which fall under their competence, to regularly assess their suitability as \nregards the IFM\u2019s organisational and operational structure, strategies, activities and risks and as \nregards the applicable legal and regulatory requirements and to report it directly to the senior \nmanagement and to the management body/governing body. They must provide the senior \nmanagement and the management body/governing body with the opinions and advice they deem \nnecessary in order to improve the arrangements regarding the central administration and the internal \ngovernance of the IFM. \n167. The persons responsible for the internal control functions must respond as soon as possible to the \nrequests for opinions and advice from the senior management and the management body/governing \nbody of the IFM or, where appropriate, the IFM\u2019s specialised committees. If they consider that \neffective, sound or prudent business management is compromised, the persons responsible for the \ninternal control functions must promptly inform, on their own initiative, the senior management and \nthe management body/governing body in accordance with the applicable internal procedures. \n168. The internal control functions must also cover the activity of branches, representative offices, \nagencies and subsidiaries owned by an IFM. \n169. It should be noted that the compliance and the internal audit functions cannot be performed by the \nsame natural person. Similarly, where the performance of the permanent compliance or internal audit \nfunction is delegated in compliance with the conditions referred to in the respective sections below \n(5.3.2. and 5.3.3.), the monitoring of these functions cannot be entrusted to the same natural person. \n170. Moreover, the persons responsible for the internal control function must submit annual reports to the \nCSSF in accordance with point 212 (for the risk management function), Sub-section 5.3.2.6. (for the \ncompliance function) and Sub-section 5.3.3.7. (for the internal audit function) below. \nCharacteristics of the internal control functions\n171.\nThe internal control functions must be permanent and independent functions each with sufficient\nauthority. The persons responsible for these functions must have the right to directly contact the \nIFM\u2019s management body/governing body and r\u00e9viseur d'entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved statutory \nauditor) as well as the CSSF. \n172. The independence of the internal control functions is incompatible with the situation in which: \n\n--- Page 30 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 30/96 \n\u2022 \nthe staff of the internal control functions are in charge of tasks they are called upon to \ncontrol; \n\u2022 \nthe internal control functions are, from an organisational point of view, included in the \nbusiness units they control or report to; and \n\u2022 \nthe remuneration of the staff of the internal control functions is linked to the \nperformance of the activities they control or is determined according to other criteria \nwhich compromise the objectivity of the work carried out by the internal control \nfunctions. \n173. The authority, which the internal control functions must have, requires that these functions should be \nable to exercise their duties, on their own initiative, express themselves freely and access all external \nand internal data and information (in all business units of the IFM they control) deemed necessary to \nfulfil their missions. \n174. The staff of the internal control functions or third parties acting on behalf of these functions must be \nobjective in carrying out their work. \n175. In order to ensure objectivity, the persons in charge of the internal control functions must exercise \nindependent thinking and judgement necessary for the proper exercise of their duties. \n176. The allocation of responsibilities and functions within the IFM must be organised so as to avoid or \nat least mitigate conflicts of interest. Where the IFM is part of a group, the existence of reporting \nlines from the IFM to the functions or persons of the group cannot jeopardise the independence of \nthe internal control functions. \n177. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the internal control functions, the members of each internal \ncontrol function must individually and collectively possess high professional skills in the field of \nIFM activities and applicable standards. These skills must be assessed by taking into account both \nthe nature of the missions of the associates and the complexity and diversity of the activities carried \nout by the IFM in order to enable full coverage of the activities and risks. These individual skills \nmust include the ability to make critical judgements and to be heard by the conducting officers of the \nIFM as well as by the management body/governing body. \n178. The persons responsible for the internal control functions must keep the acquired knowledge up to \ndate and ensure ongoing and up-to-date training for each of the associates. \n179. In addition to their high professional experience, the persons responsible for the internal control \nfunctions, who take on such a position for the first time, must have the theoretical knowledge that \nenables them to efficiently perform this function.\n180. In order to guarantee the execution of the tasks assigned to them, the internal control functions must \nhave necessary and sufficient human resources, infrastructure and budgets, pursuant to the principle \nof proportionality. The budget must be sufficiently flexible to reflect an adaptation of the missions \nof the control functions in response to changes of the IFM\u2019s risk profile. These arrangements must \nbe compatible with the use of external experts for the internal control functions in accordance with \nthe provisions set out in Sub-sections 5.3.1.6., 5.3.2.5. and 5.3.3.5. of this circular. \n181. The internal control framework must cover the whole IFM within the limits of its respective \ncompetences. \n182. Every IFM must take the necessary measures to ensure that the members of the internal control \nfunctions perform their functions with integrity and discretion. \n183. The persons responsible for the internal control functions must document the work carried out in \naccordance with the assigned responsibilities, in particular in order to allow tracking the interventions \nas well as the conclusions reached. \n\n--- Page 31 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 31/96 \n184.\nIn case of serious problems, shortcomings and irregularities, the persons responsible for the internal\ncontrol functions must inform forthwith the senior management and the management body/governing \nbody thereof. \n185. The persons responsible for the internal control functions must verify the effective follow-up of the \nrecommendations relating to the identified problems, shortcomings and irregularities. They must \nreport regularly on this subject to the senior management and management body/governing body of \nthe IFM.",

    "content": "Sub-section 5.3.1.1. Obligations of IFMs regarding risk management\n186. Articles 42(1) of the 2010 Law and 14 of the 2013 Law introduce, in particular, the obligation for an \nIFM to use a method and systems for risk management allowing it to identify, measure and control \nthe risks of UCI positions. \n187.\nThe permanent risk management function and the risk management policy are central elements\nthereof. \nSub-section 5.3.1.2. Permanent risk management function\n188.\nIn accordance with Articles 13 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 39 of Delegated Regulation (EU)\n231/2013, an IFM must, among others, establish and maintain a permanent risk management \nfunction. \n189. The permanent risk management function must be hierarchically and functionally independent from \nthe business units in accordance with Article 13(2) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and Article 14(1) of the \n2013 Law as specified in point 533 of this circular. \n190. The functional and hierarchical separation of the functions of risk management is reviewed by the \nCSSF in accordance with the principle of proportionality, on the understanding that the IFM must, \nin any event, be able to demonstrate that specific safeguards against conflicts of interest allow for the \nindependent exercise of risk management activities and that the risk management process satisfies \nthe requirements of Articles 42 of the 2010 Law and 14 of the 2013 Law and is consistently effective. \n191. The risk management function must: \n\u2022\nimplement the risk management policy and procedures;\n\u2022 \nensure compliance of the risk limit system of managed UCIs, including statutory limits \nconcerning global exposure and counterparty risk in accordance with Articles 46, 47 \nand 48 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 for UCITS and, as far as AIFs are concerned, the limits \nset in accordance with Article 44 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013; \n\u2022 \nparticipate in the identification, development and monitoring of the risk profile of UCIs \nin accordance with Articles 13 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 39 of Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 231/2013; \n\u2022 \nprovide regular reports to the management body/governing body of the IFM and, where \nit exists, the supervisory function, on the elements referred to in Article 13(3)(d) of \nCSSF Regulation 10-4 and Article 39(1)(d) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013; \n\u2022 \nprovide regular reports to the senior management of the IFM outlining the current level \nof risk incurred by each managed UCI and any actual or foreseeable breaches to the set \nlimits, so as to ensure that prompt and appropriate action can be taken; \n\u2022 \nassess and, where appropriate, contribute to the effectiveness of asset valuation systems \nand procedures in accordance with Articles 13 and 49 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 70 \nof Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \n192. The main mission of the permanent risk management function is therefore to identify, measure and \nmanage the risks of UCIs and to report to the management body/governing body and to the senior \n\n--- Page 32 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 32/96 \nmanagement of the IFM. These written reports must include analyses which allow the addressees to\nverify the consistency between: \n\u2022\nthe risk levels and the risk profile of each UCI;\n\u2022 \nthe risk levels and the limits set for each UCI; \n\u2022 \nthe risk profile and the limits set for each UCI; \nand to ensure that no new risk arises. \n193.\nThe reports must also include the measures to address identified deficiencies and to report on the\neffectiveness of the measures taken to this end. \n194. The risk profile developed for each UCI plays a central role in the mission of the permanent risk \nmanagement function. Its documentation and that of the analysis of the consistency with the set limits \nand identified risk levels must be immediately available upon the CSSF\u2019s request. \n195. In general, all interventions of the permanent risk management function must be documented. \n196. The permanent risk management function must have sufficient human and technical resources and \nthe necessary expertise to discharge its functions. In addition, it must have the necessary authority \nand access to all the relevant information which is necessary to fulfil its functions. In particular, \ncommunication channels must be put in place between the permanent risk management function and \nthe portfolio management function. Where appropriate, the permanent risk management function \nmay participate or be represented in internal committees concerning, in particular, the risk \nmanagement, the assessment and the management of UCIs. \nSub-section 5.3.1.3. Person responsible for the permanent risk management function\n197. Every IFM must, in principle, designate a person among its staff who is responsible for the permanent \nrisk management function and who possesses the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in the \narea. This person must perform his/her function under the direct responsibility of the conducting \nofficer in charge of the risk management function. \n198. The IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person responsible for the \npermanent risk management function supplemented by the following pieces of information and any \nother document which might be subsequently indicated by the CSSF: \n\u2022 \na recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated; \n\u2022 \na copy of the passport/identity card; \n\u2022 \na declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu); \nand \n\u2022 \na recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document. \n199. In the event of a change of the person responsible for the permanent risk management function, the \nIFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office \nsupplemented by the documents referred to in point 198. \n200. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, one of the conducting officers of the IFM may also be \ndirectly designated as the person responsible for the permanent risk management function provided \nthat s/he has the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in the area. Without prejudice to the \noperational model chosen, the conducting officer in charge of the permanent risk management \nfunction or directly responsible for the permanent risk management function may not, at the same \ntime, be the conducting officer responsible for investment management, even if this function is \ndelegated to a third party. Furthermore, the conducting officer in charge of the permanent risk \nmanagement function may not be in charge of the internal audit function. \n201. The person responsible for the permanent risk management function cannot at the same time be \nresponsible for the internal audit function. By contrast, it is permissible to combine the \nresponsibilities for the compliance and the risk management functions. \n\n--- Page 33 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 33/96 \n202.\nThe tasks of the person responsible for the permanent risk management function cannot be exercised\ndirectly by a member of the management body/governing body, unless s/he is part of the IFM\u2019s senior \nmanagement. \nSub-section 5.3.1.4. Risk management policy\n203. In accordance with Articles 43 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 40 of Delegated Regulation (EU) \n231/2013, an IFM must establish, implement and maintain an appropriate and documented risk \nmanagement policy which identifies the risks which the UCIs it manages are or might be exposed to. \nThis policy must be implemented by the permanent risk management function. \n204. The risk management policy must include all the necessary procedures to allow the IFM to assess for \neach UCI it manages the exposure of the UCI to market, credit, liquidity and counterparty risks, as \nwell as exposure of the UCI to any other risks, including operational risk, likely to be material for \nthe UCI.\n205. The risk management policy must cover at least the elements referred to in Articles 43 of CSSF \nRegulation 10-4 and 40 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. In particular, the description of the \ntechniques, tools and arrangements allowing the IFM to measure and manage the risks as well as the \nallocation of responsibilities within the IFM must be detailed and complete. Moreover, Articles 45 \nof CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 44 and 45 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 detail the \nrequirements regarding the risk measurement and management and regarding the risk limits. In this \ncontext, the IFM is reminded that it must in particular: \n\u2022 \nadopt adequate and effective arrangements, processes and techniques in order to \nmeasure and manage the risks which the UCIs it manages are or might be exposed to; \n\u2022 \nconduct, where appropriate, periodic stress tests and scenario analyses to address risks \narising from potential changes in market conditions that might adversely impact the \nUCIs; \n\u2022 \nset limits in accordance with the risk profiles of UCIs and control compliance with them. \n206. The above-mentioned arrangements, processes and techniques must be proportionate to the nature, \nscale and complexity of the activities of the IFM and the UCIs it manages, and in accordance with \nthe risk profiles of the UCIs. \n207. The risk management policy of the IFM must also include the techniques, tools and arrangements \nconcerning the liquidity risk management procedure which the IFM must apply, where appropriate, \nand which ensures that the liquidity profile of the investments of each UCI complies with the \nunderlying obligations, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 45 of CSSF Regulation \n10-4, Article 15 of the 2013 Law and Articles 46 to 49 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \nThese provisions specify also the IFM\u2019s obligations with respect to stress tests in the context of \nliquidity management. \n208. The risk management policy must be documented and immediately available upon the CSSF\u2019s \nrequest. \n209. In accordance with Articles 44 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 41 of Delegated Regulation (EU) \n231/2013, the IFM must in particular assess, monitor and periodically (at least once a year) review: \n\u2022 \nthe adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management policy and of the arrangements, \nprocesses and techniques used in order to measure and manage risks and ensure \ncompliance with the set limits; \n\u2022 \nthe degree of compliance by the IFM with the risk management policy and with the \nabove-mentioned arrangements, processes and techniques; \n\u2022 \nthe adequacy and effectiveness of measures taken to address any deficiencies in the \nperformance of the risk management process. \n210. Where appropriate, the IFM must make the necessary changes following this review and inform the \nCSSF of any significant change in its risk management policy. \n\n--- Page 34 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 34/96 \n211.\nMore generally, the person responsible for the permanent risk management function must report on\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management process to the management body/governing \nbody and, where it exists, to the supervisory function of the IFM in accordance with Articles 13(3)(d) \nof CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 39(1)(d) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. This report must \nindicate, in particular, the status of possible remedial measures. \n212. The written report assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management to be drawn up, \nin accordance with Articles 10(4) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 60(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU) \n231/2013, by the risk management function, must be submitted to the CSSF once a year and at the \nlatest five months following the end of the financial year of the IFM. This report may be a \nconsolidated report covering all the UCIs managed by the IFM. \nSub-section 5.3.1.5. Risk management procedure (RMP) to be communicated to the CSSF\n213.\nPursuant to Articles 42(1) of the 2010 Law and 22(2)(c) of the 2013 Law, the IFM must communicate\nto the CSSF some information on the risk management policy aimed at identifying, measuring, \nmanaging, monitoring and reporting the risks likely to be material for the UCIs it manages. This \ncommunication must be made via an RMP as described herein. \n214. As regards ManCos, for the UCITS they manage, Circular CSSF 11/512 presenting, among others, \nthe main regulatory changes in risk management and providing further clarifications on risk \nmanagement rules, specifies in Chapter V the requirements of the CSSF regarding the \ncommunication in this context. In particular, the Annex to this circular presents a framework to be \ncomplied with for this RMP. \n215. As regards AIFMs, the format of the RMP in Annex 1 of this circular must be complied with for the \nmanaged AIFs. The general section concerns the main organisation of AIFMs. Specific \ncomplementary sections must be drawn up according to the strategies of the managed AIFs: at least \none specific complementary section will be created for each type of investment strategy of the AIFs, \nas defined in Annex IV of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 (\u201cHedge Fund Strategy\u201d, \u201cPrivate \nEquity Strategy\u201d, \u201cReal Estate Strategy\u201d, \u201cFund of Fund Strategy\u201d and \u201cOther Strategy\u201d). If \nnecessary, specific sections must be drawn up at a higher degree of granularity (e.g. creation of a \nspecific complementary section for the strategy \u201cOther Strategies/Commodity fund\u201d and creation of \na specific complementary section for the strategy \u201cOther Strategies/Infrastructure fund). The \nassessment of the relevance of these specific sections is carried out by the AIFMs. However, the \nCSSF reserves the right to require one or more specific complementary section(s) if it deems it \nnecessary. \n216. The RMP must also comply with the following rules: \n\u2022 \nthe risk management procedure must strictly follow the appropriate format; \n\u2022 \nthe comments, explanations, descriptions and demonstrations provided must be brief; \n\u2022 \nall sections provided in each grid must be filled in and, where appropriate, if one of them \nis not applicable (e.g. VaR-approach for the determination of the total exposure of a \nUCITS), its heading must nevertheless be included with the indication \u201cnot applicable\u201d \nunder the heading; \n\u2022 \nthe procedure must be sent electronically to opc@cssf.lu; \n\u2022 \nthe risk management procedure must include the responses to the requirements listed in \nthis annex by considering the risk management activities subject to agreement(s) with \none or more third parties and by referring, where appropriate, to the procedures, systems \nand methods of the third parties. \n217. Any new IFM subject to Chapter 15 of the 2010 Law or Chapter 2 of the 2013 Law must include an \nRMP which has the appropriate format in the authorisation file to be submitted to the CSSF. Then, \nan update must be communicated to the CSSF at least once a year and within five months following \nthe end of the financial year of the IFM. This obligation enters into force as from the financial year \nending in 2018. It should be noted that, in case of an application for an extension of an AIFM\u2019s \n\n--- Page 35 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 35/96 \nauthorisation to a new type of AIF investment strategy, as defined in Annex IV of Delegated\nRegulation (EU) 231/2013, an RMP adapted to this new type of strategy must be submitted to the \nCSSF. \n218. Before launching a new UCI (including a compartment) and, where appropriate, when submitting \nthe authorisation file to the CSSF, the IFM must particularly ensure that the risk management policy \nand, thus, the RMP is adequate. If this is the case, the IFM must confirm it in writing to the CSSF at \nthe time of the launch and, where appropriate, at the time of the submission of the file concerning \nthis new UCI by indicating the reference of the latest submitted version of the RMP. If this is not the \ncase (e.g. the UCI\u2019s strategy is not covered by the risk management policy), the IFM must adapt its \nrisk management policy, make changes in the RMP accordingly and send this document to the CSSF \ntogether with other elements of the file relating to the new UCI. \n219. It should be noted that the procedure must cover at all times all the managed UCIs (including the \ncompartments) and that in case of significant changes in the risk management policy (e.g. change in \nthe risk management procedures or methods), the IFM must update the RMP and inform the CSSF \nby readily submitting an updated version of this procedure. \n220. The CSSF would like to point out that this RMP to be submitted to the CSSF is actually a distinct \npart of the risk management policy described in Sub-section 5.3.1.4. Indeed, whereas the risk \nmanagement procedure described here is a synthetic communication tool vis-\u00e0-vis the CSSF allowing \nit, in particular, to carry out its prudential supervision with respect to risk management, the risk \nmanagement policy is a documentation which is more free in form but more detailed in content and \nwhich includes, among others, processes, techniques, tools and allocations of responsibilities for the \nperformance of risk management. \n221. The CSSF also points out that pursuant to Article 50 of CSSF Regulation 10-4, a ManCo must \nprovide the CSSF at least once a year with a report containing information giving a true picture of \nthe types of financial instruments used for each managed UCITS, the underlying risks, the \nquantitative limits and the methods chosen for assessing the risks associated with transactions in \nderivative instruments. This report must be submitted within five months following the end of the \nfinancial year of the IFM. \nSub-section 5.3.1.6. Use of third-party experts\n222. In accordance with Articles 110(1) of the 2010 Law and 26(4) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 or Articles \n18 of the 2013 Law and 75 to 82 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 respectively, the \nperformance of some risk management tasks may be delegated to a third-party expert, provided there \nis a contract and the CSSF is notified beforehand. \n223. Where an IFM delegates some risk management activities, the provisions of Articles 110(1) of the \n2010 Law, 26(4) of CSSF Regulation 10-4, 18 of the 2013 Law and 75 to 82 of Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 231/2013 must apply. The IFM must also comply with the provisions referred to in Sub-chapter \n6.2. Delegation framework of this circular. \n224. The contract and the name of the mandated third party(ies) together with a description of the expertise \nand internal organisation of this(these) third party(ies) must be communicated to the CSSF. The fact \nthat the IFM has delegated part of the risk management to a specialised third party does not affect \nthe IFM's responsibility for the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management policy and its \nresponsibility to ensure adequate monitoring of the risks of the UCI. \n225. The ongoing monitoring of the specialised third parties in charge of risk management must cover in \nparticular the exposure of the UCI to market, liquidity, counterparty and concentration risks as well \nas to all other risks, including operational risk, which may be significant for the UCI. \n\n--- Page 36 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 36/96",

General principles\n226.\nAn IFM must have its own compliance function in Luxembourg which is organised in accordance\nwith the provisions referred to in Articles 11 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 61 of Delegated \nRegulation (EU) 231/2013 as well as with the provisions of this sub-chapter. \n227. The aim of the compliance function is to anticipate, identify and assess the compliance risks of an \nIFM as well as to assist the senior management in controlling these risks. These risks may include a \nvariety of risks such as reputational risk, legal risk, litigation risk, risk of sanctions, as well as some \noperational risk aspects, in connection with all activities of the IFM, including the activities and \nservices referred to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law and/or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law. This task \nmust be carried out on an ongoing basis and without delay. \n228. The compliance function must be able to operate independently and must comply with the principle \nof segregation of duties in order to identify any risk of non-compliance of the IFM with the \nrequirements imposed by the 2010 Law, 2013 Law, CSSF Regulation 10-4, Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 231/2013 and all other regulations applicable to the IFM. \nSub-section 5.3.2.2. Operational arrangements and compliance charter\n229.\nThe operational arrangements of the compliance function in terms of objectives, responsibilities and\npowers must be laid down in a compliance charter drawn up by the compliance function and approved \nby the senior management and ultimately by the management body/governing body. \n230. The compliance charter must at least: \n\u2022 \ndefine the position of the compliance function in the organisation chart of the IFM and \nspecify at the same time its key characteristics (independence, objectivity, integrity, \ncompetences, authority and adequacy of the resources); \n\u2022 \nrecognise the compliance function's right to take the initiative to open inquiries on all \nactivities of the IFM including those of its branches and subsidiaries in Luxembourg \nand abroad and to access all documents, evidence, minutes of the consultative and \ndecision-making bodies of the IFM, to meet all persons working in the IFM, to the extent \nrequired to fulfil its mission; \n\u2022 \ndefine the responsibilities and reporting lines of the Compliance Officer; \n\u2022 \ndescribe the relationships with the permanent risk management and internal audit \nfunctions as well as possible delegation and/or coordination needs; \n\u2022 \nestablish the conditions and circumstances applicable where external experts are used; \n\u2022 \nestablish the right for the Compliance Officer to directly and on his/her own initiative \ncontact the management body/governing body of the IFM or, where appropriate, the \nmembers of the audit committee or the compliance committee as well as the CSSF. \n231. The content of the compliance charter is brought to the attention of all staff members of the IFM, \nincluding those who work in branches abroad or in Luxembourg and in subsidiaries abroad or in \nLuxembourg. \n232. The compliance charter must be updated as soon as possible in order to take into account the changes \nin the applicable standards affecting the IFM. All changes must be approved by the senior \nmanagement, confirmed by the audit committee or, where appropriate, the compliance committee \nand ultimately approved by the management body/governing body. They must be brought to the \nattention of all staff members. \nSub-section 5.3.2.3. Specific responsibilities and scope of the compliance function\n233.\nFor the purpose of reaching the objectives set, the responsibilities of the compliance function must\ncover at least the following aspects: \n\n--- Page 37 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 37/96 \n\u2022 \nidentification of the standards to which the IFM is subject in the exercise of its activities \nand record keeping of the main rules. This record must be accessible to the relevant staff \nof the IFM; \n\u2022 \nidentification of the compliance risks to which the IFM is exposed in the exercise of its \nactivities and assessment of their significance and possible consequences. The \nclassification of the identified compliance risks must allow the compliance function to \nestablish its control plan according to the risk, thus enabling an effective use of the \nresources of the compliance function; \n\u2022 \nguarantee that the compliance risk is identified and assessed before the IFM expands \ninto new activities, products or business relationships, as well as when developing the \ntransactions and network of the group at international level; \n\u2022 \nguarantee that, for the implementation of the compliance policy, the IFM has rules that \ncan be used as guidelines by the staff from different functions and business units in the \nexercise of their day-to-day tasks. These rules must be properly reflected in the \ninstructions, procedures and internal controls in areas directly related to compliance. In \ndrawing up these rules, the compliance function must take into account, as far as \nnecessary for the IFM in question, the ethical rules laid down in the internal governance \narrangements. The compliance policy may be included in the manual of procedures \nreferred to in Section 5.5.4. of this circular; \n\u2022 \nthe areas generally related to the compliance function are the fight against money \nlaundering and terrorist financing, the prevention regarding market abuse and personal \ntransactions, the integrity of the markets in financial instruments, the protection of the \nclients' and investors\u2019 interests, the data protection (unless another person is appointed \nas Data Protection Officer in accordance with the regulation in force) and compliance \nwith confidentiality obligations, the prevention and management of conflicts of interest, \nthe prevention of the use of the financial sector by third parties to bypass their regulatory \nobligations and the management of the compliance risk related to cross-border activities. \nIn the more general context of compliance with the code of conduct, the compliance \nfunction has also to cover the areas of ethics and professional conduct or even frauds. \nThis list is not exhaustive. In general, the compliance function must be organised so that \nit covers all the areas which may result in compliance risks. However, insofar as some \nareas, resulting in practice in compliance risks, may also be linked to other functions \nsuch as the risk control function, accounting function or legal function, and for the sake \nof avoiding any duplication of the compliance controls, the areas other than those \nreferred to above may not be directly covered by the compliance function. In this case, \nit is understood that the compliance risk is to be covered by the other internal control \nfunctions in accordance with a compliance policy clearly defining the competences and \nresponsibilities of the different stakeholders in this area and subject to compliance with \nthe segregation of duties. In this case, the Compliance Officer within the IFM as referred \nto in Sub-sections 5.3.2.4. and 5.3.2.5. must assume the role of coordination, \ncentralisation and verification that the other areas which do not directly fall within \nhis/her competence are well covered. \n234. The IFM is in charge of deciding whether, in view of the particular characteristics of the activities \nperformed, its compliance function includes monitoring compliance with the rules that are not \ndirectly related to activities of management of UCIs or of discretionary management, strictly \nspeaking, such as in particular the rules under labour law, social law, company law or environmental \nlaw. \n235. The compliance function must verify compliance with the compliance policy and procedures on a \nregular basis and must propose adaptations, if required. To this end, the compliance officer must \nassess and control the compliance risk on a regular basis. In respect of the compliance risk controls \nas well as the verification of the procedures and instructions, the provisions of this circular do not \nprevent the compliance function from taking into account the internal audit work. \n\n--- Page 38 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 38/96 \n236.\nThe compliance function must centralise all information on the compliance problems (inter alia,\ninfringements of standards, non-compliance with procedures or conflicts of interest) identified in the \nIFM. \n237. As long as the compliance function has not obtained this information on its own involvement, it must \nexamine relevant documents, whether internal (e.g. internal control reports and internal audit reports, \nreports or statements of the senior management or, where appropriate, of the management \nbody/governing body) or external (e.g. reports of the external auditor, correspondence from the \nsupervisory authority). \n238. The Compliance Officer must assist and advise the senior management on issues of compliance and \nstandards, notably by drawing its attention to changes in standards which may subsequently have an \nimpact on the compliance area. \n239. The compliance function must raise awareness of the staff about the significance of compliance and \nrelated aspects and assist them in the daily activities relating to compliance. To this end, it must also \ndevelop an ongoing training programme and ensure its implementation. \nSub-section 5.3.2.4. Person responsible for the permanent compliance function\n240. Every IFM must, pursuant to Article 11(3)(b) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 or Article 61(3)(b) of \nDelegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013, appoint a person responsible for compliance, the Compliance \nOfficer, who has the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in the area. The IFM must \ncommunicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of its Compliance Officer supplemented by the \nfollowing pieces of information and any other document which might be subsequently indicated by \nthe CSSF: \n\u2022 \na recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated; \n\u2022 \na copy of the passport/identity card; \n\u2022 \na declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu); \nand \n\u2022 \na recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document. \n241. This person is, in principle, employed full-time by the IFM. \n242. In the event of a change of the Compliance Officer, the IFM must communicate beforehand to the \nCSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office supplemented by the documents referred \nto in point 240 above. \n243. Where, pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the creation of a full-time position for a \nCompliance Officer is not necessary, a person may be entrusted with this position on a part-time \nbasis after prior approval by the CSSF. To this end, the senior management and the management \nbody/governing body must submit to the CSSF a written request providing the grounds as well as the \nnecessary information to enable to assess that the correct application of the provisions of this circular \nand the proper performance of the compliance function remain assured. \n244. The Compliance Officer of the IFM is, in principle, the key contact person of the competent \nauthorities in relation to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing for any questions \nin this respect as well as in relation to market abuse. S/he is also in charge of the transmission of any\ninformation or statement to these authorities. \n245. The other tasks carried out by this employee must remain consistent with the responsibilities \nincumbent upon him/her pursuant to the provisions of this circular. In principle, it is possible for the \nCompliance Officer to provide legal services to the IFM. \n246. It is also possible that, upon specific approval by the CSSF, the conducting officer in charge of the \ncompliance function takes up the position of Compliance Officer him/herself. \n247. The role of the Compliance Officer cannot be ensured by a member of the management \nbody/governing body of the IFM unless s/he is member of the IFM\u2019s senior management. \n\n--- Page 39 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 39/96 \nSub-section 5.3.2.5. Use of third-party experts or technical means\n248. An IFM whose authorisation is limited to the management of UCIs may invoke, via a specific prior \nderogation request based on an adequate justification, the possibility of delegating the performance \nof the compliance function to a third party in accordance with Article 10(2)(c) of CSSF Regulation \n10-4 and Article 6(2)(d) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \n249. However, an IFM providing, in addition to management of UCIs, one or more of the services referred \nto in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law is not in principle authorised to \ndelegate the performance of the compliance function. \n250. In general, the IFM which has one or more branches is not allowed to delegate the performance of \nthe compliance function. However, the CSSF may derogate based on an adequate justification from \nthis above-mentioned general principle provided that the importance of the activity and the size of \nthe branch(es) so justify. \n251. Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the IFM may thus, upon duly justified derogation, \ndelegate the performance of the compliance function either by using third-party experts or technical \nmeans (external expert) or by establishing, where appropriate, a functional link with the group\u2019s \ncompliance function for the performance of compliance tasks. \n252. The senior management must select these third parties on the basis of an analysis of suitability \nbetween the IFM's needs and the specific services and competences offered by these third parties. \nThe choice of the external expert carrying out the compliance work must be approved by the \nmanagement body/governing body. The use of an external expert must be based on a written mandate. \nThe expert must carry out the work in compliance with the applicable regulatory and internal \nprovisions (notably the compliance charter). The external expert must carry out its work in \naccordance with the provisions of this sub-chapter. In this respect, it must take over all duties and \nresponsibilities incumbent upon the compliance under this circular. \n253. The IFM which decides to delegate the performance of the compliance function must submit \nbeforehand a written request to the CSSF. This request must include the information necessary for \nthe assessment, including in particular:\n\u2022 \nthe name of the external expert, legal person; \n\u2022 \nthe description of the competences and internal organisation of this external expert, legal \nperson; \n\u2022 \nthe name of the external expert, natural person, who will perform the IFM\u2019s compliance \nfunction; \n\u2022 \nthe curriculum vitae of the natural person who will perform the compliance function; \n\u2022 \na copy of the identity card of the natural person who will perform the compliance \nfunction. \n254. The principle of proportionality does not allow an IFM to exist without a compliance function. Thus, \nthe IFM which uses third-party experts or technical means must designate from among its employees \na Compliance Officer who will monitor the work of the external expert. This person must have \nsufficient knowledge of the Luxembourg regulations concerning the activity of management of UCIs \nand, where appropriate, the discretionary management. The identity of this person must be notified \nbeforehand to the CSSF. This notification must be accompanied by the following pieces of \ninformation and any other document which the CSSF may request subsequently: \n\u2022 \na recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated; \n\u2022 \na copy of the passport/identity card; \n\u2022 \na declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu); \nand\n\u2022 \na recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document. \n\n--- Page 40 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 40/96 \n255.\nIn the event of a change of the Compliance Officer referred to in point 254, the IFM must\ncommunicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office \nsupplemented by the documents referred to in point 254. \nSub-section 5.3.2.6. Obligations regarding the drawing-up of reports\n256. The Compliance Officer must report in writing on a regular basis, and, where necessary, on an ad \nhoc basis, to the senior management and, where appropriate, to the specialised committees and \nmanagement body/governing body of the IFM. These reports concern the follow-up of the \nrecommendations, problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified in the past as well as the new \nproblems, shortcomings and irregularities identified. Each report must specify the risks related \nthereto as well as their seriousness (measuring the impact) and must propose corrective measures, as \nwell as, in general, the position of the persons concerned. \n257. The Compliance Officer must prepare, at least once a year, a summary report on his/her activities \nand his/her operation. As far as the operation of the compliance function is concerned, the report \nmust mention in particular the nature and level of reliance on external experts pursuant to Sub-section \n5.3.2.5. as well as any problems which may have occurred in this context. This report must be \nsubmitted for approval to the management body/governing body and, where appropriate, the \nspecialised committees and for information purposes to the senior management. \n258. The summary report of the compliance function must be provided to the CSSF annually. The CSSF \nmust receive this document within five months following the end of the financial year of the IFM. \n259. It is recommended that the summary report of an IFM\u2019s compliance function covers at least the \nfollowing information: \n\u2022 \nthe description and assessment of the organisation of the permanent compliance \nfunction, including the human and technical resources, the hierarchical and functional \nlines and, where appropriate, the description of the nature and level of reliance on \nexternal experts as well as the assessment of possible problems which appeared in this \ncontext; \n\u2022 \nthe description of the main objectives and work carried out by the compliance function \nduring the financial year, including in particular the implementation and development \nof new procedures, the regulatory monitoring and analyses of legal and regulatory texts; \n\u2022 \nthe description of the compliance monitoring plan adopted using a risk-based approach \nwhich includes the monitored activities, the risk assessed for each activity and the \ntimetable set for carrying out the monitoring provided for in the compliance monitoring \nplan following a multi-year programme; \n\u2022 \nthe list of the main recommendations made to the senior management of the IFM, the \n(existing or emerging) problems, the significant shortcomings and irregularities which \nhave occurred since the last report, the measures taken with regard to these shortcomings \nand irregularities as well as the list of significant problems, shortcomings and \nirregularities identified in the last report but which have not yet been subject to \nappropriate corrective measures, particularly as regards AML/CFT, the monitoring of \ndelegates in accordance with the provisions referred to in Chapter 6 of this circular and \nthe monitoring of the compliance of the activities carried out within the branches and \nsubsidiaries, where appropriate. \n260. In the summary report, the Compliance Officer must take into account any other information deemed \nrelevant, for instance in the following areas (non-exhaustive list): \n\u2022 \ngovernance of the IFM; \n\u2022 \ncompliance with the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to own funds and \ntheir use; \n\u2022 \nmanagement of conflicts of interest; \n\u2022 \nnet asset value errors; \n\n--- Page 41 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 41/96 \n\u2022 \nnon-compliance with the investment policy and restrictions; \n\u2022 \npersonal transactions; \n\u2022 \nbest execution; \n\u2022 \nhandling of third-party claims and complaints; \n\u2022 \nhandling of reports of infringements of the regulatory framework (whistleblowing); \n\u2022 \nnon-compliance with the applicable reporting deadlines; \n\u2022 \nfraud and cyber attacks \n\u2022 \nupdate of the manual of procedures referred to in Section 5.5.4.; \n\u2022 \napproval of new business relationships and new products; \n\u2022 \nupdate of contracts; \n\u2022 \nfollow-up carried out following interactions with the supervisory authorities (on-site \ninspections, meetings, written correspondence, telephone conversations, etc.); \n\u2022 \nreporting to the management body/governing body; \n\u2022 \nstaff training; \n\u2022 \nchanges in the compliance policy and compliance charter.",

    "content": "Sub-section 5.3.3.1. General principles\n261. An IFM must have its own internal audit function in Luxembourg which must be organised in \naccordance with the provisions referred to in Articles 12 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 62 of \nDelegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 as well as with the provisions of this sub-chapter. \n262.\nThe internal audit function constitutes within the organisation of the IFM an independent and\npermanent function of critical assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the central \nadministration, internal governance and business and risk management as a whole in order to assist \nthe management body/governing body and senior management of the IFM and to enable them to \nhave the best control over their activities and the risks related thereto and thus to protect its \norganisation and reputation. \n263. The internal audit function must be able to operate independently and must comply with the principle \nof segregation of duties in order to identify any risk of non-compliance of the IFM with the \nrequirements imposed by the 2010 Law, 2013 Law, CSSF Regulation 10-4, Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 231/2013 and all other regulations applicable to the IFM. \nSub-section 5.3.3.2. Operational arrangements and internal audit charter\n264. The operational arrangements of the internal audit function in terms of objectives, responsibilities \nand powers must be laid down in an internal audit charter drawn up by the internal audit function and \napproved by the senior management, confirmed, where approrpiate, by the audit committee and \nultimately approved by the management body/governing body of the IFM. \n265. The internal audit charter must at least: \n\u2022 \ndefine the position of the internal audit function in the organisation chart of the IFM and \nspecify at the same time its key characteristics (independence, objectivity, integrity, \ncompetences, authority and adequacy of the resources); \n\u2022 \nconfer on the internal audit function the right of initiative and authorise it to review all \nthe activities and functions of the IFM including those of its branches abroad and in \nLuxembourg and subsidiaries abroad and in Luxembourg, to access all documents, \nevidence, minutes of the consultative and decision-making bodies of the IFM, to meet \nall persons working in the IFM, to the extent required to fulfil its mission; \n\u2022 \nlay down the hierarchical and functional lines of communication for the conclusions \ndrawn from the audit engagements; \n\u2022 \ndefine the relationships with the compliance and risk management functions; \n\n--- Page 42 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 42/96 \n\u2022 \nestablish the conditions and circumstances applicable where third-party experts are \nused; \n\u2022 \ndefine the nature of the work and conditions under which the internal audit function may \nprovide internal consulting services or perform other special engagements, define the \nresponsibilities and reporting lines of the person responsible for the internal audit \nfunction; \n\u2022 \nestablish the right for the person responsible for the internal audit to directly and on \nhis/her own initiative contact the management body/governing body or, where \nappropriate, the members of the audit committee as well as the CSSF; \n\u2022 \nspecify that the internal audit engagements are performed in accordance with the \nrecognised professional standards; \n\u2022 \nspecify the procedures to be observed in respect of coordination and cooperation with \nthe r\u00e9viseur d'entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved statutory auditor). \n266. The content of the internal audit charter is brought to the attention of all staff members of the IFM, \nincluding, where appropriate, those who work in branches in Luxembourg or abroad and in \nsubsidiaries in Luxembourg or abroad. \n267. The internal audit charter must be updated as soon as possible to take into account the changes that \nhave occurred. All changes must be approved by the senior management, confirmed, where \nappropriate, by the audit committee and ultimately approved by the management body/governing \nbody. They must be brought to the attention of all staff members. \n268. The internal audit function of the IFM must employ sufficient staff and have sufficient overall \nexpertise to cover all the IFM\u2019s activities. The person responsible for the internal audit function must \nhave sufficient knowledge of audit techniques. \n269. In order not to challenge their independence of judgement, the internal auditors cannot be in charge \nof the preparation or implementation of elements of the central administration and internal \ngovernance arrangements. This principle does not prevent them from taking part in the \nimplementation of sound internal control mechanisms through opinions and recommendations which \nthey provide in this respect. \nSub-section 5.3.3.3. Specific responsibilities and scope of the internal audit function\n270. In general, the internal audit function must review and assess whether the IFM\u2019s central \nadministration and internal governance arrangements are adequate and operate effectively. In this \nrespect, the internal audit function must assess, among others: \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of compliance with the laws and regulations and the prudential \nrequirements imposed by the CSSF;\n\u2022 \nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the internal control; \n\u2022 \nthe adequacy of the IFM\u2019s organisation, including, in particular, the monitoring of \ndelegates as well as the implementation of the procedure for the approval of new \nbusiness relationships and new products; \n\u2022 \nthe adequacy of the accounting and IT function; \n\u2022 \nthe adequacy of the segregation of duties and of the exercise of activities; \n\u2022 \nthe accurate and complete registration of the transactions and the compilation of \naccurate, comprehensive, relevant and understandable financial and prudential \ninformation which is available without delay to the management body/governing body, \nto specialised committees, where appropriate, and to the senior management and the \nCSSF; \n\u2022 \nthe implementation of the decisions taken by the senior management and by the persons \nacting by delegation and under their responsibility; \n\u2022 \nthe compliance with the procedures governing capital adequacy as specified in Chapter \n3 (Own funds) of this circular; \n\n--- Page 43 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 43/96 \n\u2022 \nthe operation and effectiveness of the compliance and risk management functions. \n271. The internal audit must be independent from the other internal control functions which it audits. \nConsequently, the risk management function or the compliance function cannot be performed by the \nperson responsible for the internal audit function of the IFM. However, these functions may take into \naccount the internal audit work as regards the verification of the correct application of the standards \nin force to the exercise of the activities by the IFM. \n272. The internal auditor must ensure that the department applies the international standards of the \nInstitute of Internal Auditors or equivalent international standards. \n273. The multi-year internal audit plan must be provided to the CSSF upon request. \nSub-section 5.3.3.4. Person responsible for the permanent internal audit function\n274. The IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person responsible for the \ninternal audit function supplemented by the following pieces of information and any other document \nwhich might be subsequently indicated by the CSSF: \n\u2022 \na recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated; \n\u2022 \na copy of the passport/identity card; \n\u2022 \na declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu);\nand \n\u2022 \na recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document. \n275. In the event of a change of the person responsible for internal audit, the IFM must communicate \nbeforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office supplemented by the \ndocuments referred to in point 274 above. \n276. The role of the person responsible for internal audit cannot be ensured by a member of the \nmanagement body/governing body of the IFM unless s/he is member of the IFM\u2019s senior \nmanagement.\nSub-section 5.3.3.5. Use of third-party experts or technical means\n277. An IFM whose authorisation is limited to the management of UCIs may invoke, via a specific prior \nderogation request based on an adequate justification, the possibility of delegating the performance \nof the internal audit function to a third party. \n278. However, an IFM providing one or more of the services referred to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law \nor Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law in addition to management of UCIs is not in principle authorised to \ndelegate the performance of the internal audit function. \n279. In general, the IFM which has one or more branches is not allowed to delegate the internal audit \nfunction to an external expert specialised in internal audit (external expert). However, the CSSF may \nderogate based on an adequate justification from this above-mentioned general principle provided \nthat the importance of the activity and the size of the branch(es) so justify. \n280. Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the IFM may thus, upon duly justified derogation, \ndelegate the internal audit function to an external expert. The external expert may be an internal \nauditor of the group to which the IFM belongs. In that case, the IFM has the possibility to establish, \nwhere appropriate, a functional link with the group\u2019s internal audit function for the performance of \ninternal audit tasks. \n281. The senior management must select these third parties on the basis of an analysis of suitability \nbetween the IFM's needs and the specific services and competences offered by these third parties. \nThe choice of the external expert carrying out the internal audit work must be approved by the \nmanagement body/governing body. The use of an external expert must be based on a written mandate. \nThe expert must carry out the work in compliance with the applicable regulatory and internal \nprovisions (notably the internal audit charter). The external expert must carry out its work in \n\n--- Page 44 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 44/96 \naccordance with the provisions of this sub-chapter. In this respect, it must take over all duties and\nresponsibilities incumbent upon the internal audit under this circular. \n282. The IFM which decides to delegate the performance of the internal audit function must submit \nbeforehand a written request to the CSSF. This request must include the information necessary for \nthe assessment, including in particular: \n\u2022 \nthe name of the external expert, legal person; \n\u2022 \nthe description of the competences and internal organisation of this external expert, legal \nperson; \n\u2022 \nthe name of the external expert, natural person, who will perform the IFM\u2019s internal \naudit function; \n\u2022 \nthe curriculum vitae of the natural person in charge of the internal audit engagement; \n\u2022 \na copy of the identity card of the natural person in charge of the internal audit \nengagement. \n283. In any event, the appointed external expert must be independent from the r\u00e9viseur d\u2019entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 \n(approved statutory auditor) of the IFM or from the cabinet de r\u00e9vision agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved audit firm) \nas well as from the group to which the r\u00e9viseur (auditor) belongs. \n284. The principle of proportionality does not allow an IFM to exist without an internal audit function. \nThus, the IFM which delegates the internal audit function to an external expert must designate from \namong its employees a person responsible for the internal audit function. This person must have \nsufficient knowledge in audit in order to monitor the work of the external expert or, where \nappropriate, to coordinate the exercise of internal audit activities with the group\u2019s internal audit \nfunction. The identity of the person responsible for the internal audit function in charge of monitoring \nthe work of the external expert must be notified beforehand to the CSSF. This notification must be \naccompanied by the following pieces of information and any other document which the CSSF may \nrequest subsequently: \n\u2022 \na recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated; \n\u2022 \na copy of the passport/identity card; \n\u2022 \na declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu); \nand\n\u2022\na recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document.\n285. In the event of a change of the person responsible for the internal audit function referred to in point \n284, the IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her \nin office supplemented by the documents referred to in point 284. \n286. Irrespective of whether the performance of the internal audit function is delegated or not, one member \nof the senior management must be responsible for the internal audit function. This function cannot \nbe performed by the conducting officer assigned to the compliance function or risk management \nfunction or by the conducting officer responsible for compliance with the AML/CFT professional \nobligations. The internal audit function must prepare a report for the senior management as a whole. \nSub-section 5.3.3.6. Performance of the internal audit function according to an internal audit plan\n287. All internal audit engagements must be planned and executed in accordance with an internal audit \nplan. The plan must be drawn up by the person responsible for the internal audit function for a period \nof several years (generally three years). Its purpose is to cover all activities and functions of the IFM, \ntaking into account both the risks posed by an activity or function of the IFM and the effectiveness \nof the organisation and internal control in place for this activity or function. The plan must take into \naccount the opinions of the management body/governing body and the senior management. The plan \nmust cover all matters of prudential interest (including the CSSF's comments and requests) and must \nalso reflect the developments and innovations provided for as well as the risks which may arise \ntherefrom. \n\n--- Page 45 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 45/96 \n288.\nThe plan must be discussed with the senior management and submitted to the latter for approval,\nconfirmed, where appropriate, by the audit committee and ultimately approved by the management \nbody/governing body. It should be reviewed on an annual basis and adapted, where appropriate, to \ndevelopments and emergencies. Any adaptation is to be formally approved by the senior management \nand, where appropriate, the audit committee. The approval implies that the senior management \nprovides the person responsible for the internal audit function with the means necessary to implement \nthe internal audit plan. \n289. In the summary report to the management body/governing body pursuant to point 298 below, the \nperson responsible for the internal audit function must indicate and explain the main changes made \nto the audit plan as initially approved by the management body/governing body. \n290. The plan, which is adequately documented, must set out the objectives of each mission and the scope \nof the tasks to be executed, give an estimate of the necessary time and human and material resources \nand assign an audit frequency to each activity and risk. \n291. The internal audit plan must also provide for the adequate and sufficiently frequent coverage, within \na planning period of several years, of important or complex activities which represent a significant \npotential risk, including a reputational risk. It must focus on the risk of execution errors and the risk \nof fraud. \n292. The person responsible for the internal audit function must regularly inform the senior management \nof the implementation of the internal audit plan. \n293. Each internal audit engagement must be planned, executed and documented pursuant to the \nprofessional standards adopted by the internal audit function in its internal audit charter. \n294. Where the internal audit department of the parent company of the Luxembourg IFM regularly carries \nout on-site inspections of its subsidiary, it is recommended, for reasons of effectiveness, that the \nLuxembourg IFM coordinate, as far as possible, its internal audit plan with that of its parent company. \n295. In case of use of an external expert, this expert must carry out his/her work under the internal audit \nplan of the IFM by following a work programme, by producing detailed documentation on his/her \nwork and by drafting the reports for each engagement. These reports are to be drafted in French, \nGerman or English and to be given to the person responsible for the internal audit, the senior \nmanagement, where appropriate, the audit committee and the management body/governing body. \nSub-section 5.3.3.7. Obligations regarding the drawing-up of reports\n296. The person responsible for the internal audit function must report in writing on a regular basis, and, \nwhere necessary, on an ad hoc basis, to the senior management and, where appropriate, to the \nspecialised committees and management body/governing body of the IFM. These reports concern \nthe follow-up of the recommendations, problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified in the \npast as well as the new problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified. Each report must specify \nthe risks related thereto as well as their seriousness (measuring the impact) and must propose \ncorrective measures, as well as in general the position of the persons concerned. \n297. Every engagement must be subject to a written report of the internal auditor, generally for the audited \npersons, the senior management and, possibly as a summary, for the management body/governing \nbody in accordance with point 298 below. The reports must also be made available to the r\u00e9viseur \nd'entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved statutory auditor) and the CSSF. These reports must be drafted in \nFrench, German or English. \n298. The person responsible for the internal audit function must prepare, at least once a year, a summary \nreport on his/her activities and his/her operation. As far as the operation of the internal audit function \nis concerned, the report must mention in particular the nature and level of reliance on external experts \npursuant to Sub-section 5.3.3.5. as well as any problems which may have occurred in this context. \nAs regards the activities, every summary report must include a statement to the senior management \nof the main recommendations on significant problems (existing or emerging), shortcomings and \n\n--- Page 46 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 46/96 \nirregularities identified since the last report, the measures taken in this respect as well as the statement\non the significant problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified in the last report but which \nhave not yet been subject to appropriate corrective measures. This report must be submitted for \napproval to the management body/governing body and for information purposes to the senior \nmanagement. \n299. It is recommended that the summary report of an IFM\u2019s internal audit function also cover, over a \nperiod of several years (generally three years), at least the following information: \n\u2022 \nthe functions included in the activity of collective portfolio management as defined in \nAnnex II of the 2010 Law or the functions included in Annex I of the 2013 Law, \nrespectively; \n\u2022 \nthe discretionary management and non-core services referred to in Article 101(3)(a) of \nthe 2010 Law and Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law, where appropriate; \n\u2022 \nthe valuation function; \n\u2022 \nthe compliance and risk management functions; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of delegated activities; \n\u2022 \nthe accounting function; \n\u2022 \nthe IT function; \n\u2022 \nthe functioning of the senior management and management body/governing body; \n\u2022 \nthe internal governance and organisation of the IFM; \n\u2022 \nthe rules of conduct; \n\u2022 \nthe management of conflicts of interest; \n\u2022 \nthe claim and complaint handling; \n\u2022 \nthe remuneration policy; \n\u2022 \nthe approval of new business relationships and new products; \n\u2022 \nthe branches and subsidiaries, where appropriate. \n300. The summary report of the internal audit function must cover, on an annual basis, compliance with \nthe AML/CFT professional obligations in accordance with Sub-section 5.4.1.3. (Internal audit \ncontrol). \n301. The summary report referred to in point 298 must be provided to the CSSF annually. The CSSF must \nreceive this document within five months following the end of the financial year of the IFM.",

In addition, every IFM is also subject to the Law of 27 October 2010 \nwhich, among other things, implements United Nations Security Council resolutions as well as acts \nadopted by the European Union concerning prohibitions and restrictive measures in financial matters \n\n--- Page 47 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 47/96 \nin respect of certain persons, entities and groups in the context of the combat against terrorist\nfinancing, as well as to Articles 33(1) and 39(1) of CSSF Regulation 12-02 on the obligation of \nongoing due diligence in this context. In this respect, EU regulations directly applicable in national \nlaw or via the adoption of ministerial regulations also apply to every IFM. The IFM must be organised \nso as to take into account and apply the new laws and regulations on this subject as soon as they \nbecome applicable. The IFM is also urged to follow the publications of the Financial Action Task \nForce (FATF) on this subject, including those related to financial sanctions relating to terrorist \nfinancing and those relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction and its financing. Similarly, the IFM must follow Guidances for the Securities \nSector issued by the FATF. \n306. When carrying out UCI management and, where appropriate, the discretionary management and non-\ncore services referred to in Article 101(3)(a) of the 2010 Law and Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law, every \nIFM must take appropriate measures to identify and assess money laundering and terrorist financing \n(ML/TF) risks to which it is exposed by taking into account the risk factors, including those linked \nto customers, countries or geographical areas, products, services and transactions or delivery \nchannels. The IFM must take effective measures to mitigate these risks. \n307. The professional obligations laid down in the AML/CFT Law and the Law of 27 October 2010 must \nbe implemented effectively by every IFM. Compliance with these obligations must be subject to \nregular monitoring and verifications at a frequency determined according to the risks to the which \nthe IFM is exposed and at least every time the relevant obligations change. \n308. Every IFM must implement due diligence measures, in particular, on clients, initiators of UCIs, \nportfolio managers to whom it delegates the management and on investment advisers. The IFM must \nimplement due diligence measures which are adapted to ML/TF risks which may arise from the UCIs \nit manages. \n309. Pursuant to Articles 3(7) and 4(1) of the AML/CFT Law, the IFM must also apply due diligence \nmeasures on the assets of the UCIs it manages. \n310.

This list must be provided within five months following the end of the \nfinancial year of the IFM. \n326. Moreover, the IFM must put in place the measures necessary to ensure that the intermediaries comply \nwith the provisions of this section as well. The due diligence measures must be adapted to the ML/TF \nrisks which may arise from these intermediaries.\n327. The IFM must also comply with the provisions referred to in Section 6.2.3. (Initial due diligence and \nongoing monitoring of the delegates) with respect to the marketing intermediaries, insofar as some \nissues are not covered in point 328 below. \n328. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 4 of the AML/CFT Law, the IFM must establish internal policies, \ncontrols and procedures which include, among others, arrangements for due diligence on \nintermediaries who ensure the marketing as laid down in Article 3 of the AML/CFT Law. These \narrangements must take the form, among others, of initial and ongoing due diligence covering at least \nthe points referred to in Article 3(2) of the AML/CFT Law and the following aspects (non-exhaustive \nlist): \na) \nthe types of intermediaries chosen by the IFM and the collection of information on the \ncountry of establishment of the intermediary and the applicable AML/CFT legal and \nregulatory framework, the supervisory authority and regime applicable to it, the \nownership and control structure of the intermediary; \nb) \nthe collection of sufficient information to understand fully the nature of the intermediary \nand to determine from publicly available information the reputation of the intermediary \nand the quality of supervision; \nc) \nthe collection of documents required pursuant to the IFM\u2019s AML/CFT obligations when \nentering into a business relationship with an intermediary (Know Your Intermediary); \nd) \nthe distribution channels, the risks of which must be assessed in accordance with the \nfactors referred to particularly in points 215 and 216 of the Joint Guidelines \n(EBA/ESMA/EIOPA) on ML/TF risk factors adopted by way of Circular CSSF 17/661; \nthus, for example, the use of unclear or complex distribution channels and the fact that \nthe intermediary is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risks are high \nrisk factors requiring the implementation of an enhanced monitoring of these \nintermediaries; \ne) \nthe country risk to be assessed in accordance with the factors referred to particularly in \npoint 217 of the Joint Guidelines (EBA/ESMA/EIOPA) on ML/TF risk factors adopted \nby way of Circular CSSF 17/661. \n329.

It is important that this Management Information includes, among \nothers, the monitoring of the activities of the IFM and its UCIs, the result of the relevant controls and \nanalyses and the monitoring of incidents. \n342. In this context, the Management Information must cover, at least: \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the legal and corporate life; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the financial and accounting activity and of the level of own funds; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of human resources; \n\u2022 \nthe functions included in the collective portfolio management activity as defined in \nAnnex II of the 2010 Law or the functions included in Annex I of the 2013 Law, \nrespectively, among which the launch of new products, the monitoring of the UCI \nperformance, the monitoring of the best execution policy and the monitoring of \nincidents (significant and non-significant errors of the net asset value, breaches of limits, \nvaluation problems, problems of reconciliation, situations giving rise to conflicts of \ninterest and other problems, marketing incidents, ML/TF incidents, etc.); \n\u2022 \nthe discretionary management and non-core services referred to in Article 101(3)(a) of \nthe 2010 Law and Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law, where appropriate; \n\u2022 \nthe results of the controls carried out on the delegated activities, including analyses of \nthese results carried out by the IFM; \n\u2022 \nthe analyses of the risk management of the IFM and UCIs, including the monitoring of \nthe operational risk; \n\u2022 \nthe results of the controls on the effective and proper implementation of the general \ninvestment policy and of the strategy of the managed UCIs; \n\u2022 \nthe results of the controls of the adequate transparency in the prospectus and, where \nappropriate, in the UCITS-KIID and/or the PRIIPs-KID of every managed UCI in \nrelation to the general investment policy and the strategy implemented; \n\u2022 \nthe result of the work carried out by the compliance function; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the observations of the internal audit function; \n\n--- Page 53 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 53/96 \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the IT function and related incidents (cyber attacks and other intrusion \nattempts); \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the ML/TF risk level in relation to UCIs; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of third-party claims and complaints; \n\u2022 \nwhere appropriate, the monitoring of the activities carried out by the branch(es); \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the issues raised during preceding meetings. \n343. As the Management Information must also provide information about the controls made on the \ndelegated activities, every IFM must ensure that it receives all necessary information from the \ndelegates in order to carry out an effective control of every delegate. In addition, it is important that, \nprior to any delegation, the IFM ensures that the delegates will be able to provide this information. \n344.

In any case, the size of the team cannot consist \nof less than three FTE staff members, in accordance with point 123 of this circular. \n415. Article 82 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 defines the concept of letter-box entity with \nrespect to AIFMs. \n416. The fact that the IFM has delegated some functions to third parties does not affect the IFM\u2019s liability. \n417. Among the activities which cannot be delegated to third parties and which must be performed by an \nIFM, the following tasks are noteworthy: \n\u2022 \nthe determination of the general investment policy for all UCIs which did not adopt the \nform of a company; \n\u2022 \nthe determination, where appropriate together with the management body/governing \nbody of the UCI which adopted the form of a company, of the risk profile of each \nmanaged UCI; \n\u2022 \nthe interpretation of analyses of the risk management, including any necessary \ncorrective measures, where appropriate; \n\u2022 \nthe implementation and monitoring of a conflict of interest policy; \n\u2022 \nthe implementation and monitoring of a best execution policy; \n\u2022 \nin the absence of a representative price, assurance that the management body/governing \nbody of the UCI has taken a decision relating to the determination of the probable \nrealisation value estimated with care and in good faith and to give the management \nbody/governing body of the UCI the necessary support for this kind of decision; \n\u2022 \nthe decision regarding the choice of delegates to be appointed; \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring and control of delegated functions. \n418.

Any use of a delegate within the meaning of point 1(9) of this circular must be subject to a prior \nwritten initial due diligence carried out on the third party by the IFM. \n442. In accordance with Article 110(1)(f), (g) and (h) of the 2010 Law and Article 18(1)(f) of the 2013 \nLaw, the IFM must be able to effectively monitor and control at any time the delegated task. After\nhaving received the mandate, the delegate must be subject to proper ongoing monitoring by the IFM. \nSub-section 6.2.3.2. Establishment of a delegation framework procedure\n443. All IFMs must define and implement a procedure which covers all aspects of delegation. \n444. In particular, the procedure must describe the process of selection and change of a delegate.\n445. All IFMs must implement procedures and arrangements allowing them to ensure that the delegated \nactivity(ies) is(are) carried out in compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions in force. \n446. The procedure must include the implementing rules for initial and periodic due diligence carried out \nby the IFM on all its delegates and the requirements applicable in case of sub-delegation, as described \nin points 422 and 423. \n\n--- Page 64 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 64/96 \n447.\nThe procedure must describe the measures taken which allow the persons who conduct the business\nof the IFM and its operating staff to effectively monitor the business of the undertaking to which the \nmandate has been given on an ongoing basis, in order to ensure that the exercise and quality of the \nactivities are monitored as if they were carried out internally. The procedure must set out reporting \nrequirements to which the delegates are subject. The drawing-up of the contract referred to in Section \n6.2.2. above must take these obligations into account. \n448. In particular, the procedure must determine the nature, scope and frequency of the periodic due \ndiligence to be carried out on delegates taking into account a risk-based approach. When carrying \nout its risk assessment, the IFM must take into account not only the risks incurred by every delegate \nbut also the number of delegates it uses. \n449. The IFM must implement a multi-year plan (generally three years) for conducting periodic due \ndiligence on delegates. This plan must be updated taking into account the risk-based approach \ndetermined by the IFM and provided that the principle of proportionality which the IFM may rely on \nto increase or reduce this update frequency is applied. \n450. Moreover, the procedure must describe the escalation measures and decision-making procedures \nregarding delegation. \n451. Under no circumstances can the monitoring of the activities delegated to a third party be delegated. \nThus, the IFM must have staff in Luxembourg which are sufficient in number and qualified to carry \nout a proper monitoring of the delegated activities taking into account the risks arising from the \ndelegation(s) identified by the IFM and the number of delegates. The procedure must identify which \ndepartments or staff members of the IFM are in charge of the ongoing monitoring of delegates. \n452. The IFM may take into account transversal or specific skills existing within the group to which it \nbelongs when implementing its control arrangements. In that case, the IFM must participate in the \nprocess of selection of delegates and of maintaining the delegation relationship. In particular, the \nIFM must ensure to have access to documents received during the initial due diligence and ongoing \nmonitoring operations. \n453. The procedure must describe the measures allowing the IFM to ensure the continuity of operations \nin case of withdrawal of the mandate. \n454. Moreover, the IFM must ensure that the data protection is guaranteed at all times. \nSub-section 6.2.3.3. Details on the initial due diligence\n455. When carrying out the initial due diligence, the IFM must, among others, identify and assess all risks \narising from the delegation, in particular, the operational, financial, legal and reputational risks in \norder to manage them appropriately in accordance with the IFM\u2019s risk management policy. \n456. The initial due diligence must allow the IFM to ensure that the undertaking to which functions will \nbe delegated is qualified and capable of performing these functions, depending on the nature of the \ndelegated functions, in compliance with the legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. \n457.\nMoreover, the initial due diligence must allow the IFM to ensure the delegate\u2019s ability to provide the\ninformation necessary to fulfil its ongoing monitoring obligations. During the initial due diligence, \nthe IFM must assess its ability to ensure the appropriate ongoing monitoring of the delegate given \nthe identified risks and the specificities of the delegate. Thus, for example, the geographical location \nof the delegate cannot, in principle, impede regular on-site visits. \n458. The IFM must, among others, analyse the organisational structure of the delegate. It must verify that \nthe delegate has taken appropriate measures to comply in particular with the requirements regarding \nthe organisation, conflicts of interest and rules of conduct laid down in CSSF Regulation 10-4 as well \nas the other operating conditions referred to in Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. The above-\nmentioned requirement also applies to partial delegation of one or more functions. The IFM must \nalso effectively monitor the compliance with these requirements by the third party. \n\n--- Page 65 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 65/96 \n459.\nBesides the authorisations which may be required by applicable regulations, the entities to which\nfunctions are delegated must prove that they have adequate human and technical resources in view \nof the delegated functions. \n460. In their assessment of risks arising from delegation, as referred to in point 448 above, and in order to \nassess the quality of the contemplated delegate, the IFM must take into account all relevant criteria \nincluding in particular the following listed information (non-exhaustive list): \n\u2022 \nthe jurisdiction in which the delegate is located; \n\u2022 \nthe regulation and/or supervision by a supervisory authority; \n\u2022 \nwhere appropriate, the nature of the authorisations received by the delegate; \n\u2022 \nwhere appropriate, the sanctions imposed by a supervisory authority; \n\u2022 \nthe reputation of the delegate; \n\u2022 \nthe delegate\u2019s shareholding structure; \n\u2022 \nthe delegate\u2019s governance structure; \n\u2022 \nthe delegate\u2019s organisational structure; \n\u2022 \nthe organisation of the control functions within the delegate (compliance, internal audit, \nrisk control); \n\u2022 \nthe skills and abilities of the delegate; \n\u2022 \nthe financial situation of the delegate by reviewing, for example, the annual accounts \nand the opinion issued by the r\u00e9viseur d'entreprises (statutory auditor) or an equivalent; \n\u2022 \nthe absence of suspicion of money laundering and terrorist financing; \n\u2022 \nthe quality of the delegate\u2019s IT systems; \n\u2022 \nthe business continuity plan and the disaster recovery plan of the delegate (BCP/DRP); \n\u2022 \nthe measures implemented by the delegate to ensure data protection, in particular when \nthe delegate is located outside Luxembourg; \n\u2022 \nthe risk of conflicts of interest between the IFM and its delegate and the management of \nthese risks; \n\u2022 \nthe review of the claims and complaints received by the delegate; \n\u2022 \nthe sub-delegation by the delegate and the delegate\u2019s ongoing monitoring measures with \nrespect to its own delegates; \n\u2022 \nthe ability of the delegate to provide sufficient and relevant reports and key performance \nindicators for the ongoing monitoring by the IFM. \n461. The initial due diligence includes a written critical analysis concerning at least the information listed \nin point 460 above as well as any element deemed relevant given the nature of the delegated function. \nTo this end, the IFM must ensure to apply the specific provisions referred to in Sub-chapters 6.3. to \n6.6. of this circular. \n462. All due diligence must be formalised in a written report which includes at least: \n\u2022 \nthe description of the due diligence measures taken in accordance with the risk-based \napproach as referred to in point 448 above such as, for example, the submission of an \ninitial questionnaire and the analysis of this questionnaire and related documents; the \nanalysis of all relevant reports such as, for example, the reports on the functioning of \nthe relevant controls, audit reports, etc.; the review of the relevant policies and \nprocedures implemented within the delegate; the meetings (on the phone or on site) with \nthe persons responsible within the delegate, formalised in the minutes of the meeting; \nthe controls, where appropriate, in the premises of the delegate during an on-site visit, \netc.; \n\u2022 \nthe description and critical analysis of the observations made; \n\u2022 \nthe results of the analysis of the information and documents received during the due \ndiligence assessment; \n\u2022 \nwhere appropriate, the escalation measures taken; \n\n--- Page 66 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 66/96 \n\u2022 \nthe conclusions reached, then validated, dated and signed by all the bodies of the IFM \nempowered to approve or refuse this delegation, as defined in the procedure referred to \nin Sub-section 6.2.3.2. In case the delegation is approved, the conclusions must indicate \nin particular the frequency and nature of the subsequent periodic due diligence to be \ncarried out. The due diligence report must be reviewed by the approval committee of \nthe IFM referred to in Section 5.5.3. which takes the final decision. \n463. The initial due diligence must be finalised, dated and signed before the entry into force of the contract \nwith the delegate referred to in Section 6.2.2. above. \n464. The initial due diligence assessments must be documented and kept at the IFM\u2019s head office. \n465.\nThe initial due diligence assessments must be made available to the CSSF upon request and sent\nwithout delay. \nSub-section 6.2.3.4. Details on the ongoing monitoring\n466. The ongoing monitoring of the delegates must allow the IFM to: \n\u2022 \nensure that the services provided by the delegate are continuously in compliance, not \nonly with the legal and regulatory provisions but also with the contractual provisions \nand that the quality of the services are satisfactory; \n\u2022 \nassess over time the adequacy of the organisational structure and the procedures of the \ndelegate with respect to the delegated activity and determine if the delegate is qualified \nand able to perform these functions; \n\u2022 \nreassess regularly the risks arising from every delegation in order to appropriately \nmanage the risks. \n467. This ongoing monitoring is based: \n\u2022 \non the exercise of periodic due diligence, on the one hand; \n\u2022 \non the implementation of a procedure for the ongoing monitoring of the delegated \nactivities, on the other hand. \nPeriodic due diligence\n468. The periodic due diligence includes a written critical analysis of the delegate\u2019s business and \norganisation while applying a risk-based approach. To this end, the IFM reassesses the criteria \nanalysed during the initial due diligence (point 460 above) and includes, where appropriate, any other \nrelevant criterion. \n469. All due diligence must be formalised in a written report dated and signed and which includes, in \naddition to the information referred to in point 462 above, the following information: \n\u2022 \nthe monitoring of the observations made during the previous due diligence. The due \ndiligence report describes the action plans and timetable for their implementation. \nMoreover, the report describes the escalation measures taken; \n\u2022 \nthe conclusions reached, then validated, dated and signed by all the bodies of the IFM \nempowered to decide to keep or end this delegation, as defined in the procedure referred \nto in Sub-section 6.2.3.2. as well as the conditions for maintaining this relationship. In \ncase the decision has been made to maintain the delegation, the conclusions must \nindicate in particular the frequency of the subsequent periodic due diligence to be carried \nout. \n470. The provisions referred to in points 464 and 465 must apply mutatis mutandis to the periodic due \ndiligence. \n \n \n\n--- Page 67 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 67/96 \nOngoing monitoring\n471.\nThe ongoing monitoring obliges the IFM to implement control arrangements which allow the\nmonitoring of the business of the delegates within the meaning of point 1(9) of this circular. \n472. Moreover, this requirement obliges the IFM to implement control arrangements which allow the \nsenior management and its staff to access the data documenting the activities exercised by the \ndelegate(s) for and on behalf of the IFM and the UCIs under its management. \n473. The Management Information referred to in Section 5.5.1. must also allow the monitoring of the \ndelegates\u2019 activity.\n474. Thus, the conducting officers must regularly receive detailed reports on the results of the control \narrangements, including in particular key performance indicators, for all the UCIs managed by the \nIFM. The frequency of submission and the detail of such reports will be determined by the profile of \nthe managed UCIs and their inherent risks. The IFM must determine and implement its own key\nperformance indicators when the key performance indicators provided by the delegate are not \nsufficient to ensure an appropriate ongoing monitoring. \n475. Moreover, the IFM must define and implement a methodology to analyse the results of the control \narrangements and set up its own warning systems in order to monitor its delegates according to a \nrisk-based approach. The analysis of this information must be documented in writing and made \navailable to the CSSF upon request. \n476. In the case where the delegate uses a standard for the internal control such as for example the ISAE \n3402, the IFM may take this information into account for the organisation of its monitoring of the \ndelegate.",

This procedure must cover at least the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 \nthe description of the portfolio management process for all the strategies followed by \nthe UCIs and for every type of contemplated instrument; \n\u2022 \nthe identification of the operating staff members involved in the process as well as the \ndetermination of their respective roles. To this end, a flow chart of the investment \nprocess must be included in the portfolio management procedure; \n\u2022 \nthe arrangements for taking investment and disinvestment decisions on behalf of the \nUCIs and their formalisation; \n\u2022 \nthe control arrangements regarding the existence and performance of investments; \n\u2022 \nthe control arrangements regarding compliance with the objectives, the investment \nstrategies and, where appropriate, the risk limits of the managed UCIs; \n\u2022 \nthe control arrangements regarding the adequate transparency in the prospectus and, \nwhere appropriate, in the UCITS-KIID and/or the PRIIPs-KID of every managed UCI \nin relation to the general investment policy and the strategy implemented; \n\n--- Page 68 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 68/96 \n478.\nSpecific provision applicable to AIFMs: The AIFM must, in addition, comply with Articles 18 and\n19 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. In accordance with Article 19 of Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 231/2013 concerning investments in assets of limited liquidity which are preceded by a \nnegotiation phase, the portfolio management procedure must describe in particular: \n\u2022\nthe functioning of and search for possible consistent transactions;\n\u2022 \nthe process of analysing and assessing the selected transactions; \n\u2022 \nthe functioning of the due diligence activities related to the transactions prior to \narranging execution; \n\u2022 \nthe control arrangements regarding the performance of the AIF. \nSub-section 6.3.1.2. Details on the staff and IT systems\n479. The IFM performing internally the portfolio management function must have sufficient staff with the \nnecessary skills, knowledge and expertise regarding portfolio management having regard to the \nstrategies managed by the IFM. \n480.\nThe IFM which is directly in charge of the portfolio management of one or more UCIs, without using\nan external portfolio manager, must make appropriate arrangements for suitable IT systems so as to \npermit the timely and proper recording of each portfolio transaction according to Articles 8 and 15 \nof CSSF Regulation 10-4 and Articles 58 and 64 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \nSub-section 6.3.1.3. Functioning of the portfolio management committee\n481.\nWhere the IFM establishes a portfolio management committee, it is recommended that the IFM\ncomply with the following conditions: \n\u2022\nthe members of the committee collectively have the necessary professional experience\nand skills having regard to the managed strategies; \n\u2022 \nthe committee is (not necessarily exclusively) composed of members of the senior \nmanagement and of the staff of the IFM who are permanently located in Luxembourg \nor who have their domicile in a place allowing them, in principle, to come to \nLuxembourg every day; it is recommended that the conducting officer in charge of the \nportfolio management function be part of the portfolio management committee; \n\u2022 \nthe operational arrangements of the committee, including in particular the composition \nof the committee and the rules regarding the voting rights (majority, veto, etc.) in \ncompliance with the legal provisions on independence of the functions, must be \ndocumented. This document must be provided to the CSSF upon request; \n\u2022 \nthe work of the committee must be documented. This documentation includes the \nagenda of the meetings, the minutes of the meetings documenting in particular the \nassessment of risks associated with the contemplated investment, the decisions and \nmeasures taken by the committee. \nSub-section 6.3.1.4. Use of investment advisers\n482. In order to perform effectively its function and to benefit from the specific skills taking into account \nthe strategy of the UCI, the IFM may use the services of investment advisers provided that the \nfollowing cumulative conditions are complied with: \n\u2022 \nthe IFM must define and implement a procedure which describes the IFM\u2019s critical and \nindependent analysis of the transactions proposed by the investment adviser. Moreover, \nthe document must describe the decision-making process within the IFM with respect \nto the approval or refusal to carry out the proposed investment. The analysis by the IFM \nmust be carried out prior to the execution of the transaction and must be documented in \nwriting. A simple verification by the IFM that the transaction complies with the UCI\u2019s \ninvestment restrictions is not sufficient; \n\u2022 \nwhen the investment process is based on the adviser\u2019s proposal of an investment \nuniverse in which it predetermined a precise, limited and detailed list of financial \n\n--- Page 69 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 69/96 \ninstruments in which the UCI may invest (\u201cwhite list\u201d), this list must be subject to prior\nanalysis and validation by the IFM; \n\u2022 \nwhen the IFM uses an investment model (including, for example, an algorithm) drawn \nup by the adviser, this investment model must be subject to prior analysis and validation \nby the IFM; \n\u2022 \nthe IFM must ensure that adequate disclosure is made in the prospectus of the UCIs, \nhighlighting the exact role of the IFM and the investment adviser in accordance with the \nprovisions of Articles 151(1) of the 2010 Law and 21(1)(d) of the 2013 Law. \n483. The composition of the portfolio management committee referred to in point 481 and the rules \nregarding the voting rights within this committee must ensure that the IFM takes effective decisions \non investment choices. Thus, for example, if an investment adviser is in the portfolio management \ncommittee, its role should, in principle, be limited to an advisory role. \n484. Every IFM which uses the services of an investment adviser must implement measures allowing it \nto ensure that this investment adviser has sufficient skills and experience on an ongoing basis taking \ninto account the risk profile of the UCI and the strategies of this UCI.",

In addition to the general provisions on the delegation framework as laid down in Sub-chapter 6.2. \n(Delegation framework) above, the following specific conditions are applicable. \n486. Where the delegation concerns the portfolio management, the mandate may only be given to \nundertakings authorised or registered for the purpose of portfolio management and subject to \nprudential supervision. \n487. Where the mandate concerning the portfolio management has been given to a third-country \nundertaking, the cooperation between the CSSF and the supervisory authority of this country must\nbe ensured. The CSSF determines which supervisory authorities fulfil this condition. \n488. As regards the AIFs in particular, where the conditions referred to in points 486 and 487 cannot be \nmet, the CSSF may derogate from them in accordance with Article 18(1)(c) and (d) of the 2013 Law. \n489. No mandate with regard to the core function of portfolio management can be given to the depositary \nor to a delegate of the depositary or to any other undertaking whose interests may conflict with those \nof the IFM or the unit-holders. \n490. This provision does not prohibit the delegation of the portfolio management function to a company \nbelonging to the same group as the depositary. In this case, the CSSF will only authorise the \ndelegation if it has proof that measures protecting the interests of the IFM and the unit-holders have \nbeen put in place.\n491. While complying with the general investment policy and the investment limits contained in the \nprospectus, the UCI\u2019s fund rules or the UCI\u2019s instruments of incorporation, the entities to which the \ninvestment management function has been delegated must manage the portfolio in accordance with \ninvestment-allocation criteria periodically laid down by the IFM or the management body/governing \nbody of the UCI which took the form of a company, respectively. \n492. Therefore, the delegation contract will indicate the investment policy and, where appropriate, the \ninvestment limits applicable to the UCI (or to each compartment, if the delegation concerns one or \nmore compartments of a UCI with multiple compartments), and, where appropriate, the specific asset \nallocation criteria defined by the management body/governing body of the IFM or the management \nbody/governing body of the UCI which adopted the form of a company, respectively. These \nprovisions may be included in the delegation contract by means of a reference to the provisions \ncontained in the prospectus, the UCI\u2019s fund rules, the instruments of incorporation or the issue \ndocuments or, where appropriate, the partnership agreement of the UCI concerned, subject to specific \n\n--- Page 70 ---\nCircular CSSF 18/698 \n \nPage 70/96 \ninstructions which may be given from time to time by the management body/governing body of the\nIFM, by the management body/governing body of the UCI which adopted the form of a company or \nby the persons who conduct the business of the IFM.

Furthermore, \nit must ensure that these investment decisions are carried out in compliance with the objectives, the \ninvestment strategy and the risk limits of the managed UCIs. \n494. Where an IFM has delegated the portfolio management, it must, from the moment it enters into the \nrelationship, monitor on an ongoing basis that each delegate has suitable IT systems in order to meet \nthe requirements of Articles 8, 9, 15 and 16 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and Articles 58, 59, 64 and 65 \nof Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. \nSub-section 6.3.2.2.

An IFM established in Luxembourg may be authorised to delegate the administration of a UCI that \nit manages to a third party which has all the necessary authorisations and a suitable organisation in \norder to perform this function. \n510. However, different rules of delegation in the area of UCI administration are applicable depending on \nthe home Member State of the UCI. \n511. In the case where a Luxembourg IFM manages a regulated Luxembourg UCI, it is authorised to \ndelegate the administration of this UCI to a delegate established in the territory of Luxembourg (i.e. \nbank, professional of the financial sector, IFM) which has all the necessary authorisations and a \nsuitable organisation to perform this function.\n512. Where a Luxembourg IFM intends to manage UCIs established in a country other than Luxembourg \nand to use an administrative agent established outside Luxembourg, the IFM must also inform the \nCSSF in accordance with the provisions referred to in Section 6.2.1. (Obligation to notify the CSSF) \nand must apply the provisions of Section 6.2.3. (Initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring of \ndelegates).

In accordance with Article 17(4)(b) of the 2013 Law, the AIFM must ensure that the valuation task \nis functionally independent from the portfolio management and the remuneration policy and that \nother measures ensure that conflicts of interest are mitigated and that undue influence upon the \nemployees is prevented. \n533. In accordance with Article 14 of the 2013 Law pursuant to which the risk management function must \nbe independent from the operating units, the AIFM must, in particular, ensure the independence \nbetween the risk management and valuation activities. Given that for some assets, among which \nespecially complex and illiquid financial instruments, the risk of inappropriate valuation is higher, it \nis recommended that the AIFMs, authorised to manage strategies and complex and illiquid financial \ninstruments and which decided to perform internally the valuation function, separate the risk \nmanagement function and the valuation function. However, the CSSF may apply the principle of \nproportionality in its assessment of the organisation of the valuation function in accordance with the \nabove article. \n534. When performing the valuation function internally, the AIFM may use third-party experts. However, \nthe liability of the AIFM towards the AIF and its investors is not affected. \n535. Where the valuation function is not performed by an independent external valuer pursuant to Article \n17(9) of the 2013 Law, the CSSF may require that the valuation procedures and/or the valuations of \nthe AIFM as well as the model(s) used in accordance with Article 68 of Delegated Regulation (EU) \n231/2013 be checked by an external valuer or, where appropriate, by a r\u00e9viseur d'entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 \n(approved statutory auditor). \n536.

All the conditions set forth under Part II above remain applicable. Additional requirements apply that \nare specific to the activity of the management of portfolios of investments on a client-by-client basis. \nIt should be borne in mind that, in accordance with point 305 of this circular, the IFM referred to in \nthis part is also subject to the AML/CFT laws and regulations in force, among which the AML/CFT \nLaw, the Law of 27 October 2010, CSSF Regulation 12-02, CSSF circulars on AML/CFT and the \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions as well as acts adopted by the European Union. \n559.

Thus, an IFM may be authorised to apply the principle of proportionality when organising its \npermanent risk management (Section 5.3.1.), compliance (Section 5.3.2.), internal audit (Section \n5.3.3.) functions, subject to prior duly reasoned request. The principle of proportionality cannot be \ninvoked in order to put in place the above-mentioned functions. \n593.
