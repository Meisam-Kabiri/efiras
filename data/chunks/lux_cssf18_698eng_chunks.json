  "140. In the event the IFM uses the services of a third party, it must ensure that it has quick and unlimited  access to its own information stored at the data processing centre. This information must be encrypted  or otherwise protected according to other available technical means in order to ensure the security of  communication and the confidentiality of client data.",

  "147. The identity of the person responsible for the accounting function as well as of every person  succeeding him/her in office must be communicated forthwith to the CSSF.",
  "148. Regarding the organisation of the accounting function, the IFM can either put in place its own  accounting function, or use, under its responsibility, the accounting expertise of a third party.

In  addition, the third party must be subject to initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring pursuant to  the provisions under Sub-chapter 6.2. (Delegation framework) of this circular.",
  "149. Regardless of the organisation of the accounting function, particularly the use of a third party, the  accounting documents relating to the activity of the IFM must always be available and/or accessible  electronically at the head office of the IFM in Luxembourg to enable the IFM to draw up a balance  sheet and a profit and loss account in an independent way.",

While defining and implementing these procedures, the IFM must ensure compliance with  the principle of integrity in order to avoid in particular that the accounting system is used for  fraudulent purposes.",
  "152. The concept of central administration also implies that the IFM must have its own premises in Luxembourg. Access to the IFM\u2019s premises must be secure and restricted to the IFM\u2019s staff. In the  event of a change of premises, the IFM must inform beforehand the CSSF in order to obtain approval  of any amendments to the articles of incorporation. The file transmitted to the CSSF must include a  plan of the premises and, if the IFM does not own the premises, the lease agreement.",
  "153. In accordance with Articles 109 and 111 of the 2010 Law as well as Articles 16 and 11 of the 2013 Law, every IFM must have robust internal governance arrangements which ensure the sound and  prudent management of its activities and the risks inherent therein.",

In this respect, these persons must be able to contact and inform, directly and on their own  initiative, the management body/governing body or, where appropriate, the members of the audit  committee as well as the CSSF.",

The main purpose of the internal control functions is to verify compliance with all the internal  policies and procedures which fall under their competence, to regularly assess their suitability as  regards the IFM\u2019s organisational and operational structure, strategies, activities and risks and as  regards the applicable legal and regulatory requirements and to report it directly to the senior  management and to the management body/governing body.

  "196. The permanent risk management function must have sufficient human and technical resources and  the necessary expertise to discharge its functions. In addition, it must have the necessary authority  and access to all the relevant information which is necessary to fulfil its functions. In particular,  communication channels must be put in place between the permanent risk management function and  the portfolio management function.

  "200. By virtue of the principle of proportionality, one of the conducting officers of the IFM may also be  directly designated as the person responsible for the permanent risk management function provided  that s/he has the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in the area.

Furthermore, the conducting officer in charge of the permanent risk  management function may not be in charge of the internal audit function.",
  "201. The person responsible for the permanent risk management function cannot at the same time be  responsible for the internal audit function. By contrast, it is permissible to combine the  responsibilities for the compliance and the risk management functions.",
  "203. In accordance with Articles 43 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 40 of Delegated Regulation (EU)  231/2013, an IFM must establish, implement and maintain an appropriate and documented risk  management policy which identifies the risks which the UCIs it manages are or might be exposed to.  This policy must be implemented by the permanent risk management function.",
  "204. The risk management policy must include all the necessary procedures to allow the IFM to assess for  each UCI it manages the exposure of the UCI to market, credit, liquidity and counterparty risks, as  well as exposure of the UCI to any other risks, including operational risk, likely to be material for  the UCI.",
  "205. The risk management policy must cover at least the elements referred to in Articles 43 of CSSF  Regulation 10-4 and 40 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013. In particular, the description of the  techniques, tools and arrangements allowing the IFM to measure and manage the risks as well as the  allocation of responsibilities within the IFM must be detailed and complete.

  "209. In accordance with Articles 44 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 41 of Delegated Regulation (EU)  231/2013, the IFM must in particular assess, monitor and periodically (at least once a year) review:   \u2022  the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management policy and of the arrangements,  processes and techniques used in order to measure and manage risks and ensure  compliance with the set limits;  \u2022  the degree of compliance by the IFM with the risk management policy and with the  above-mention",

This report may be a  consolidated report covering all the UCIs managed by the IFM.",
  "213. Pursuant to Articles 42(1) of the 2010 Law and 22(2)(c) of the 2013 Law, the IFM must communicate to the CSSF some information on the risk management policy aimed at identifying, measuring,  managing, monitoring and reporting the risks likely to be material for the UCIs it manages. This  communication must be made via an RMP as described herein.",
  "214. As regards ManCos, for the UCITS they manage, Circular CSSF 11/512 presenting, among others,  the main regulatory changes in risk management and providing further clarifications on risk  management rules, specifies in Chapter V the requirements of the CSSF regarding the  communication in this context. In particular, the Annex to this circular presents a framework to be  complied with for this RMP.",
  "215. As regards AIFMs, the format of the RMP in Annex 1 of this circular must be complied with for the  managed AIFs. The general section concerns the main organisation of AIFMs. Specific  complementary sections must be drawn up according to the strategies of the managed AIFs: at least  one specific complementary section will be created for each type of investment strategy of the AIFs,  as defined in Annex IV of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 (\u201cHedge Fund Strategy\u201d, \u201cPrivate  Equity Strategy",

  "218. Before launching a new UCI (including a compartment) and, where appropriate, when submitting  the authorisation file to the CSSF, the IFM must particularly ensure that the risk management policy  and, thus, the RMP is adequate. If this is the case, the IFM must confirm it in writing to the CSSF at  the time of the launch and, where appropriate, at the time of the submission of the file concerning  this new UCI by indicating the reference of the latest submitted version of the RMP. If this i",

If this is not the  case (e.g. the UCI\u2019s strategy is not covered by the risk management policy), the IFM must adapt its  risk management policy, make changes in the RMP accordingly and send this document to the CSSF  together with other elements of the file relating to the new UCI.",
  "219. It should be noted that the procedure must cover at all times all the managed UCIs (including the  compartments) and that in case of significant changes in the risk management policy (e.g. change in  the risk management procedures or methods), the IFM must update the RMP and inform the CSSF  by readily submitting an updated version of this procedure.",
  "220. The CSSF would like to point out that this RMP to be submitted to the CSSF is actually a distinct  part of the risk management policy described in Sub-section 5.3.1.4. Indeed, whereas the risk  management procedure described here is a synthetic communication tool vis-\u00e0-vis the CSSF allowing  it, in particular, to carry out its prudential supervision with respect to risk management, the risk  management policy is a documentation which is more free in form but more detailed in content and  wh",

  "221. The CSSF also points out that pursuant to Article 50 of CSSF Regulation 10-4, a ManCo must  provide the CSSF at least once a year with a report containing information giving a true picture of  the types of financial instruments used for each managed UCITS, the underlying risks, the  quantitative limits and the methods chosen for assessing the risks associated with transactions in  derivative instruments. This report must be submitted within five months following the end of the  financial ye",

In accordance with Articles 110(1) of the 2010 Law and 26(4) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 or Articles  18 of the 2013 Law and 75 to 82 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 respectively, the  performance of some risk management tasks may be delegated to a third-party expert, provided there  is a contract and the CSSF is notified beforehand.",
  "223. Where an IFM delegates some risk management activities, the provisions of Articles 110(1) of the  2010 Law, 26(4) of CSSF Regulation 10-4, 18 of the 2013 Law and 75 to 82 of Delegated Regulation  (EU) 231/2013 must apply. The IFM must also comply with the provisions referred to in Sub-chapter  6.2. Delegation framework of this circular.",
  "224. The contract and the name of the mandated third party(ies) together with a description of the expertise  and internal organisation of this(these) third party(ies) must be communicated to the CSSF. The fact  that the IFM has delegated part of the risk management to a specialised third party does not affect  the IFM's responsibility for the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management policy and its  responsibility to ensure adequate monitoring of the risks of the UCI.",
  "225. The ongoing monitoring of the specialised third parties in charge of risk management must cover in  particular the exposure of the UCI to market, liquidity, counterparty and concentration risks as well  as to all other risks, including operational risk, which may be significant for the UCI.",
  "226. An IFM must have its own compliance function in Luxembourg which is organised in accordance with the provisions referred to in Articles 11 of CSSF Regulation 10-4 and 61 of Delegated  Regulation (EU) 231/2013 as well as with the provisions of this sub-chapter.",
  "227. The aim of the compliance function is to anticipate, identify and assess the compliance risks of an  IFM as well as to assist the senior management in controlling these risks. These risks may include a  variety of risks such as reputational risk, legal risk, litigation risk, risk of sanctions, as well as some  operational risk aspects, in connection with all activities of the IFM, including the activities and  services referred to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law and/or Article 5(4) of the",
  "es referred to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law and/or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law. This task  must be carried out on an ongoing basis and without delay.",
  "228. The compliance function must be able to operate independently and must comply with the principle  of segregation of duties in order to identify any risk of non-compliance of the IFM with the  requirements imposed by the 2010 Law, 2013 Law, CSSF Regulation 10-4, Delegated Regulation  (EU) 231/2013 and all other regulations applicable to the IFM.",
  "229. The operational arrangements of the compliance function in terms of objectives, responsibilities and powers must be laid down in a compliance charter drawn up by the compliance function and approved  by the senior management and ultimately by the management body/governing body.",
  "230. The compliance charter must at least:   \u2022  define the position of the compliance function in the organisation chart of the IFM and  specify at the same time its key characteristics (independence, objectivity, integrity,  competences, authority and adequacy of the resources);  \u2022  recognise the compliance function's right to take the initiative to open inquiries on all  activities of the IFM including those of its branches and subsidiaries in Luxembourg  and abroad and to access all documents",

  "231. The content of the compliance charter is brought to the attention of all staff members of the IFM,  including those who work in branches abroad or in Luxembourg and in subsidiaries abroad or in  Luxembourg.",
  "232. The compliance charter must be updated as soon as possible in order to take into account the changes  in the applicable standards affecting the IFM. All changes must be approved by the senior  management, confirmed by the audit committee or, where appropriate, the compliance committee  and ultimately approved by the management body/governing body. They must be brought to the  attention of all staff members.",
  "233. For the purpose of reaching the objectives set, the responsibilities of the compliance function must cover at least the following aspects:",

The IFM is in charge of deciding whether, in view of the particular characteristics of the activities  performed, its compliance function includes monitoring compliance with the rules that are not  directly related to activities of management of UCIs or of discretionary management, strictly  speaking, such as in particular the rules under labour law, social law, company law or environmental  law.",
  "237. As long as the compliance function has not obtained this information on its own involvement, it must  examine relevant documents, whether internal (e.g. internal control reports and internal audit reports,  reports or statements of the senior management or, where appropriate, of the management  body/governing body) or external (e.g. reports of the external auditor, correspondence from the  supervisory authority).",
  "238. The Compliance Officer must assist and advise the senior management on issues of compliance and  standards, notably by drawing its attention to changes in standards which may subsequently have an  impact on the compliance area.",
  "239. The compliance function must raise awareness of the staff about the significance of compliance and  related aspects and assist them in the daily activities relating to compliance. To this end, it must also  develop an ongoing training programme and ensure its implementation.",
  "240. Every IFM must, pursuant to Article 11(3)(b) of CSSF Regulation 10-4 or Article 61(3)(b) of  Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013, appoint a person responsible for compliance, the Compliance  Officer, who has the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise in the area. The IFM must  communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of its Compliance Officer supplemented by the  following pieces of information and any other document which might be subsequently indicated by  the CSSF:   \u2022  a recent cur",

  "242. In the event of a change of the Compliance Officer, the IFM must communicate beforehand to the  CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office supplemented by the documents referred  to in point 240 above.",
  "243. Where, pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the creation of a full-time position for a  Compliance Officer is not necessary, a person may be entrusted with this position on a part-time  basis after prior approval by the CSSF.

S/he is also in charge of the transmission of any information or statement to these authorities.",
  "245. The other tasks carried out by this employee must remain consistent with the responsibilities  incumbent upon him/her pursuant to the provisions of this circular. In principle, it is possible for the  Compliance Officer to provide legal services to the IFM.",
  "246. It is also possible that, upon specific approval by the CSSF, the conducting officer in charge of the  compliance function takes up the position of Compliance Officer him/herself.",
  "248. An IFM whose authorisation is limited to the management of UCIs may invoke, via a specific prior  derogation request based on an adequate justification, the possibility of delegating the performance  of the compliance function to a third party in accordance with Article 10(2)(c) of CSSF Regulation  10-4 and Article 6(2)(d) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013.",
  "249. However, an IFM providing, in addition to management of UCIs, one or more of the services referred  to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law is not in principle authorised to  delegate the performance of the compliance function.",
  "250. In general, the IFM which has one or more branches is not allowed to delegate the performance of  the compliance function. However, the CSSF may derogate based on an adequate justification from  this above-mentioned general principle provided that the importance of the activity and the size of  the branch(es) so justify.",
  "251. Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the IFM may thus, upon duly justified derogation,  delegate the performance of the compliance function either by using third-party experts or technical  means (external expert) or by establishing, where appropriate, a functional link with the group\u2019s  compliance function for the performance of compliance tasks.",
  "252. The senior management must select these third parties on the basis of an analysis of suitability  between the IFM's needs and the specific services and competences offered by these third parties.  The choice of the external expert carrying out the compliance work must be approved by the  management body/governing body. The use of an external expert must be based on a written mandate.  The expert must carry out the work in compliance with the applicable regulatory and internal  provisions (n",

The external expert must carry out its work in  accordance with the provisions of this sub-chapter. In this respect, it must take over all duties and  responsibilities incumbent upon the compliance under this circular.",
  "253. The IFM which decides to delegate the performance of the compliance function must submit  beforehand a written request to the CSSF. This request must include the information necessary for  the assessment, including in particular:",

  "254. The principle of proportionality does not allow an IFM to exist without a compliance function. Thus,  the IFM which uses third-party experts or technical means must designate from among its employees  a Compliance Officer who will monitor the work of the external expert.

The internal audit function must be able to operate independently and must comply with the principle  of segregation of duties in order to identify any risk of non-compliance of the IFM with the  requirements imposed by the 2010 Law, 2013 Law, CSSF Regulation 10-4, Delegated Regulation  (EU) 231/2013 and all other regulations applicable to the IFM.",
  "264. The operational arrangements of the internal audit function in terms of objectives, responsibilities  and powers must be laid down in an internal audit charter drawn up by the internal audit function and  approved by the senior management, confirmed, where approrpiate, by the audit committee and  ultimately approved by the management body/governing body of the IFM.",
  "265. The internal audit charter must at least:   \u2022  define the position of the internal audit function in the organisation chart of the IFM and  specify at the same time its key characteristics (independence, objectivity, integrity,  competences, authority and adequacy of the resources);  \u2022  confer on the internal audit function the right of initiative and authorise it to review all  the activities and functions of the IFM including those of its branches abroad and in  Luxembourg and subsidiarie",

  "266. The content of the internal audit charter is brought to the attention of all staff members of the IFM,  including, where appropriate, those who work in branches in Luxembourg or abroad and in  subsidiaries in Luxembourg or abroad.",
  "267. The internal audit charter must be updated as soon as possible to take into account the changes that  have occurred. All changes must be approved by the senior management, confirmed, where  appropriate, by the audit committee and ultimately approved by the management body/governing  body. They must be brought to the attention of all staff members.",
  "268. The internal audit function of the IFM must employ sufficient staff and have sufficient overall  expertise to cover all the IFM\u2019s activities. The person responsible for the internal audit function must  have sufficient knowledge of audit techniques.",
  "269. In order not to challenge their independence of judgement, the internal auditors cannot be in charge  of the preparation or implementation of elements of the central administration and internal  governance arrangements. This principle does not prevent them from taking part in the  implementation of sound internal control mechanisms through opinions and recommendations which  they provide in this respect.",
  "270. In general, the internal audit function must review and assess whether the IFM\u2019s central  administration and internal governance arrangements are adequate and operate effectively. In this  respect, the internal audit function must assess, among others:   \u2022  the monitoring of compliance with the laws and regulations and the prudential  requirements imposed by the CSSF; \u2022  the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal control;  \u2022  the adequacy of the IFM\u2019s organisation, including, in parti",

  "compliance with the procedures governing capital adequacy as specified in Chapter  3 (Own funds) of this circular;",
  "271. The internal audit must be independent from the other internal control functions which it audits.  Consequently, the risk management function or the compliance function cannot be performed by the  person responsible for the internal audit function of the IFM. However, these functions may take into  account the internal audit work as regards the verification of the correct application of the standards  in force to the exercise of the activities by the IFM.",
  "272. The internal auditor must ensure that the department applies the international standards of the  Institute of Internal Auditors or equivalent international standards.",
  "274. The IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person responsible for the  internal audit function supplemented by the following pieces of information and any other document  which might be subsequently indicated by the CSSF:   \u2022  a recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated;  \u2022  a copy of the passport/identity card;  \u2022  a declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu); and  \u2022  a recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other",
  "and  \u2022  a recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document.",

  "276. The role of the person responsible for internal audit cannot be ensured by a member of the  management body/governing body of the IFM unless s/he is member of the IFM\u2019s senior  management.",
  "277. An IFM whose authorisation is limited to the management of UCIs may invoke, via a specific prior  derogation request based on an adequate justification, the possibility of delegating the performance  of the internal audit function to a third party.",
  "278. However, an IFM providing one or more of the services referred to in Article 101(3) of the 2010 Law  or Article 5(4) of the 2013 Law in addition to management of UCIs is not in principle authorised to  delegate the performance of the internal audit function.",
  "279. In general, the IFM which has one or more branches is not allowed to delegate the internal audit  function to an external expert specialised in internal audit (external expert). However, the CSSF may  derogate based on an adequate justification from this above-mentioned general principle provided  that the importance of the activity and the size of the branch(es) so justify.",
  "280. Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, the IFM may thus, upon duly justified derogation,  delegate the internal audit function to an external expert. The external expert may be an internal  auditor of the group to which the IFM belongs. In that case, the IFM has the possibility to establish,  where appropriate, a functional link with the group\u2019s internal audit function for the performance of  internal audit tasks.",
  "281. The senior management must select these third parties on the basis of an analysis of suitability  between the IFM's needs and the specific services and competences offered by these third parties.  The choice of the external expert carrying out the internal audit work must be approved by the  management body/governing body. The use of an external expert must be based on a written mandate.  The expert must carry out the work in compliance with the applicable regulatory and internal  provision",
  "e work in compliance with the applicable regulatory and internal  provisions (notably the internal audit charter). The external expert must carry out its work in",
  "282. The IFM which decides to delegate the performance of the internal audit function must submit  beforehand a written request to the CSSF. This request must include the information necessary for  the assessment, including in particular:   \u2022  the name of the external expert, legal person;  \u2022  the description of the competences and internal organisation of this external expert, legal  person;  \u2022  the name of the external expert, natural person, who will perform the IFM\u2019s internal  audit function",

In any event, the appointed external expert must be independent from the r\u00e9viseur d\u2019entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9  (approved statutory auditor) of the IFM or from the cabinet de r\u00e9vision agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved audit firm)  as well as from the group to which the r\u00e9viseur (auditor) belongs.",
  "284. The principle of proportionality does not allow an IFM to exist without an internal audit function.  Thus, the IFM which delegates the internal audit function to an external expert must designate from  among its employees a person responsible for the internal audit function. This person must have  sufficient knowledge in audit in order to monitor the work of the external expert or, where  appropriate, to coordinate the exercise of internal audit activities with the group\u2019s internal audit  f",

The identity of the person responsible for the internal audit function in charge of monitoring  the work of the external expert must be notified beforehand to the CSSF. This notification must be  accompanied by the following pieces of information and any other document which the CSSF may  request subsequently:   \u2022  a recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated;  \u2022  a copy of the passport/identity card;  \u2022  a declar",

  "285. In the event of a change of the person responsible for the internal audit function referred to in point  284, the IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her  in office supplemented by the documents referred to in point 284.",
  "286. Irrespective of whether the performance of the internal audit function is delegated or not, one member  of the senior management must be responsible for the internal audit function. This function cannot  be performed by the conducting officer assigned to the compliance function or risk management  function or by the conducting officer responsible for compliance with the AML/CFT professional  obligations. The internal audit function must prepare a report for the senior management as a whole.",
  "287. All internal audit engagements must be planned and executed in accordance with an internal audit  plan. The plan must be drawn up by the person responsible for the internal audit function for a period  of several years (generally three years).

The plan  must cover all matters of prudential interest (including the CSSF's comments and requests) and must  also reflect the developments and innovations provided for as well as the risks which may arise  therefrom.",
  "289. In the summary report to the management body/governing body pursuant to point 298 below, the  person responsible for the internal audit function must indicate and explain the main changes made  to the audit plan as initially approved by the management body/governing body.",
  "290. The plan, which is adequately documented, must set out the objectives of each mission and the scope  of the tasks to be executed, give an estimate of the necessary time and human and material resources  and assign an audit frequency to each activity and risk.",
  "291. The internal audit plan must also provide for the adequate and sufficiently frequent coverage, within  a planning period of several years, of important or complex activities which represent a significant  potential risk, including a reputational risk. It must focus on the risk of execution errors and the risk  of fraud.",
  "292. The person responsible for the internal audit function must regularly inform the senior management  of the implementation of the internal audit plan.",
  "293. Each internal audit engagement must be planned, executed and documented pursuant to the  professional standards adopted by the internal audit function in its internal audit charter.",
  "294. Where the internal audit department of the parent company of the Luxembourg IFM regularly carries  out on-site inspections of its subsidiary, it is recommended, for reasons of effectiveness, that the  Luxembourg IFM coordinate, as far as possible, its internal audit plan with that of its parent company.",
  "295. In case of use of an external expert, this expert must carry out his/her work under the internal audit  plan of the IFM by following a work programme, by producing detailed documentation on his/her  work and by drafting the reports for each engagement. These reports are to be drafted in French,  German or English and to be given to the person responsible for the internal audit, the senior  management, where appropriate, the audit committee and the management body/governing body.",
  "296. The person responsible for the internal audit function must report in writing on a regular basis, and,  where necessary, on an ad hoc basis, to the senior management and, where appropriate, to the  specialised committees and management body/governing body of the IFM. These reports concern  the follow-up of the recommendations, problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified in the  past as well as the new problems, shortcomings and irregularities identified.

Every engagement must be subject to a written report of the internal auditor, generally for the audited  persons, the senior management and, possibly as a summary, for the management body/governing  body in accordance with point 298 below. The reports must also be made available to the r\u00e9viseur  d'entreprises agr\u00e9\u00e9 (approved statutory auditor) and the CSSF. These reports must be drafted in  French, German or English.",
  "299. It is recommended that the summary report of an IFM\u2019s internal audit function also cover, over a  period of several years (generally three years), at least the following information:   \u2022  the functions included in the activity of collective portfolio management as defined in  Annex II of the 2010 Law or the functions included in Annex I of the 2013 Law,  respectively;  \u2022  the discretionary management and non-core services referred to in Article 101(3)(a) of  the 2010 Law and Article 5(4) of",

  "414. The concept of letter-box entity is assessed particularly in the light of the size of the teams performing  the key functions which must be appropriate given the volume of assets under management, the  complexity and number of UCIs managed by the IFM. In any case, the size of the team cannot consist  of less than three FTE staff members, in accordance with point 123 of this circular.",
  "415. Article 82 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013 defines the concept of letter-box entity with  respect to AIFMs.",

The drafting of the contracts  must take these requirements into account and specify the terms thereof.",
  "436. The contract between the IFM and the delegate must provide a right of access for the IFM to the  documents relating to transactions carried out by the delegate as well as data on UCIs upon simple  request even in electronic form.

  "439. To this end, the delegation must be structured so that compliance with the rules of conduct laid down  in Articles 111 of the 2010 Law and the other operating conditions referred to in Article 11 of the 2013 Law, as specified in Section 5.5.8. (Rules of conduct) above, are ensured and may be monitored  at any time.",

The IFM and the delegate must establish, implement and maintain a business continuity plan for the  recovery of the business after a disaster or any other exceptional event which provides for a regular  testing of the backup facilities, whenever this appears necessary in view of the nature of the delegated  task or function.",
  "441. Any use of a delegate within the meaning of point 1(9) of this circular must be subject to a prior  written initial due diligence carried out on the third party by the IFM.",
  "442. In accordance with Article 110(1)(f), (g) and (h) of the 2010 Law and Article 18(1)(f) of the 2013  Law, the IFM must be able to effectively monitor and control at any time the delegated task. After having received the mandate, the delegate must be subject to proper ongoing monitoring by the IFM.",
  "445. All IFMs must implement procedures and arrangements allowing them to ensure that the delegated  activity(ies) is(are) carried out in compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions in force.",

  "449. The IFM must implement a multi-year plan (generally three years) for conducting periodic due  diligence on delegates. This plan must be updated taking into account the risk-based approach  determined by the IFM and provided that the principle of proportionality which the IFM may rely on  to increase or reduce this update frequency is applied.",
  "450. Moreover, the procedure must describe the escalation measures and decision-making procedures  regarding delegation.",
  "451. Under no circumstances can the monitoring of the activities delegated to a third party be delegated.  Thus, the IFM must have staff in Luxembourg which are sufficient in number and qualified to carry  out a proper monitoring of the delegated activities taking into account the risks arising from the  delegation(s) identified by the IFM and the number of delegates. The procedure must identify which  departments or staff members of the IFM are in charge of the ongoing monitoring of delegates.",
  "452. The IFM may take into account transversal or specific skills existing within the group to which it  belongs when implementing its control arrangements. In that case, the IFM must participate in the  process of selection of delegates and of maintaining the delegation relationship. In particular, the  IFM must ensure to have access to documents received during the initial due diligence and ongoing  monitoring operations.",
  "453. The procedure must describe the measures allowing the IFM to ensure the continuity of operations  in case of withdrawal of the mandate.",
  "455.

  "456. The initial due diligence must allow the IFM to ensure that the undertaking to which functions will  be delegated is qualified and capable of performing these functions, depending on the nature of the  delegated functions, in compliance with the legal, regulatory and contractual obligations.",
  "457. Moreover, the initial due diligence must allow the IFM to ensure the delegate\u2019s ability to provide the information necessary to fulfil its ongoing monitoring obligations. During the initial due diligence,  the IFM must assess its ability to ensure the appropriate ongoing monitoring of the delegate given  the identified risks and the specificities of the delegate. Thus, for example, the geographical location  of the delegate cannot, in principle, impede regular on-site visits.",
  "458. The IFM must, among others, analyse the organisational structure of the delegate. It must verify that  the delegate has taken appropriate measures to comply in particular with the requirements regarding  the organisation, conflicts of interest and rules of conduct laid down in CSSF Regulation 10-4 as well  as the other operating conditions referred to in Delegated Regulation (EU) 231/2013.

  "474. Thus, the conducting officers must regularly receive detailed reports on the results of the control  arrangements, including in particular key performance indicators, for all the UCIs managed by the  IFM.
