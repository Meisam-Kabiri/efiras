We\nextend ORB-SLAM3’s optimization pipeline to jointly process ToA data from 5G base stations alongside\nvisual and inertial measurements while estimating system biases. This integration transforms the inherently\nlocal SLAM estimates into globally referenced trajectories and effectively resolves scale ambiguity in\nmonocular configurations. Our method is evaluated using both Aerolab indoor datasets with RGB-D\ncameras and the EuRoC MAV benchmark, complemented by simulated 5G ToA measurements at 28\nGHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa. Extensive experiments across multiple\nSLAM configurations demonstrate that ToA integration enables consistent global positioning across all\nmodes while maintaining local accuracy. For monocular configurations, ToA integration successfully\nresolves scale ambiguity and improves consistency. We further investigate scenarios with unknown base\nstation positions and demonstrate that ToA measurements can effectively serve as an alternative to loop\nclosure for drift correction. We also analyze how different geometric arrangements of base stations impact\nSLAM performance. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods, including UWB-VO, confirms\nour approach’s robustness even with lower measurement frequencies and sequential base station operation.\nThe results validate that 5G ToA integration provides substantial benefits for global SLAM applications,\nparticularly in challenging indoor environments where accurate positioning is critical.\nINDEX TERMS 5G Time of Arrival (ToA), Global Localization, Indoor Drone Navigation, ORB-SLAM3,\nSensor Fusion, Visual-Inertial SLAM.\nI.

RELATED WORK\nWe review the literature under three categories: visual\nSLAM, visual-inertial SLAM, and radio-based SLAM, sum-\nmarizing key advancements and challenges in each domain.\nA. VISUAL SLAM\nVisual SLAM systems, which rely primarily on camera\nsensors, have undergone significant evolutionary stages in\nalgorithmic development. Feature-based methods pioneered\nearly advancements by extracting keypoints and descriptors\nfrom images to estimate camera motion and 3D structure.\nMonoSLAM\n[13] introduced real-time monocular SLAM\nusing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to track sparse fea-\nture points, laying groundwork for subsequent approaches.\nParallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM) [14] revolutionized\nthe field by separating tracking and mapping into parallel\nthreads, enabling more efficient Bundle Adjustment (BA) for\nimproved pose estimation.\nThe ORB-SLAM series [15, 5, 12] marked a significant\nmilestone by introducing robust feature extraction using Ori-\nented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) descriptors\n[16].\nThese implementations progressively expanded SLAM ca-\npabilities, with ORB-SLAM2 supporting monocular, stereo,\nand RGB-D cameras, and ORB-SLAM3 integrating visual-\ninertial capabilities and multi-map SLAM techniques.\nDirect methods represent another critical approach, op-\nerating directly on pixel intensities without explicit feature\nextraction. Dense Tracking and Mapping (DTAM) [17] was\namong the first to use an inverse-depth representation for\ndense map construction. Large-Scale Direct SLAM (LSD-\nSLAM) [18] introduced a semi-dense approach focusing on\nhigh-gradient pixels, while Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO)\n[19] minimized photometric error over selected pixels.",

Semi-Direct Visual\nOdometry (SVO) [20] utilized direct methods for rotation\nestimation and feature-based methods for translation, achiev-\ning high-speed performance in dynamic environments. Direct\nSparse Mapping (DSM) [21] further advanced this paradigm\nby introducing photometric Bundle Adjustment for global\noptimization.\nDespite significant advancements, visual SLAM continues\nto face critical challenges: scale ambiguity in monocular\nsystems, sensitivity to environmental conditions like lighting\nand texture variations, and the persistent need to balance\ncomputational complexity with real-time performance.\nB. VISUAL-INERTIAL SLAM\nIntegrating Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) with cam-\neras addresses some limitations of visual SLAM by provid-\ning complementary motion information. IMUs offer high-\nfrequency localization and orientation data, compensating\nfor visual sensor shortcomings in fast motion or low-light\nconditions. Conversely, visual sensors help mitigate the cu-\nmulative drift commonly associated with IMUs, leading to\nmore accurate and robust localization and mapping.\nFilter-based approaches, such as Multi-State Constraint\nKalman Filter (MSCKF)\n[22], MSCKF 2.0\n[23], and\nRobust Visual-Inertial Odometry (ROVIO)\n[24], utilize\nrecursive estimation techniques to fuse visual and inertial\ndata.

We describe the distinction between local\nand global frames, ToA factor formulation, and the system\nmodifications that enable robust pose estimation across di-\nverse datasets.\nA. LOCAL FRAME VS. GLOBAL FRAME IN SLAM\nIn SLAM, the concepts of local and global reference frames\nare fundamental for accurately representing and interpreting\npositional data within a mapped environment. A local frame\nis usually established at the beginning of the mission (e.g.,\nat the first keyframe or the sensor’s starting point). Once set,\nall subsequent poses, map points, and sensor measurements\nare calculated and expressed relative to this local coordinate\nsystem. While effective for maintaining local consistency, the\nlocal frame lacks alignment with a fixed real-world reference,\nleading to cumulative drift over time. Additionally, it can\nlimit the system’s ability to integrate or compare data from\nmultiple sessions or external sources, which often require a\nglobal reference frame for alignment.\nIn contrast, a global frame is a fixed, absolute reference\nsystem tied to known landmarks or infrastructure, such as\n5G base stations in our setup. This global frame provides a\nconsistent anchor point independent of the SLAM system’s\nstarting pose. By aligning the local observations to the global\nframe, the SLAM system can mitigate drift, maintain long-\nterm positional accuracy, and ensure interoperability with\nother systems or datasets operating in the same global con-\ntext.\nFig. 2 illustrates the distinction between the local and",

TOA FACTOR FORMULATION\nToA factor integrates distance measurements from base sta-\ntions into the SLAM framework through a formulated error\nmodel.

The simulated\nToA measurements were time-aligned with the collected data\nbased on the OptiTrack trajectories.\nEuRoC MAV Dataset: To enable comparison with state-\nof-the-art methods, we also evaluated our approach on the\npublic EuRoC MAV benchmark [42].

For example, in sequence\nV104, continuous ToA measurements deliver a remarkable\n49.3% improvement in accuracy over the no-loop-closure\nbaseline, while sequence V203 shows a 33.1% improvement.\nThese significant gains demonstrate that ToA integration\ncan effectively replace loop closure in preserving trajectory\nconsistency, even without prior knowledge of base station lo-\ncations. Interestingly, in sequence V203, the baseline without\nloop closure achieves a slightly better performance (0.832\nmeters) compared to the baseline with loop closure (0.960\nmeters). This counterintuitive result may be attributed to\nsuboptimal pose graph optimizations, particularly in this\nchallenging sequence, which involves tracking losses and\nrelocalization events.

The system assumes the presence\nof a single static UWB anchor and was evaluated using the\nMachine Hall dataset from the EuRoC MAV benchmark.\nNotably, their experiments rely on simulated UWB ToA data,\ngenerated with a Gaussian distribution at a standard deviation\nof 5 cm and a frequency of 30Hz.\nUnlike UWB-VO, which relies on a single simulated UWB\nanchor at 30 Hz, our approach evaluates both single and\nsequential base station setups (Fig 11) at a lower, more prac-\ntical 5 Hz measurement rate.

ANALYSIS OF BASE STATION CONFIGURATIONS\nFOR SLAM PERFORMANCE\nIn this section, we analyze the impact of the base station\nposition on the SLAM performance. Geometric Dilution of\nPrecision (GDOP) plays a crucial role in determining local-\nization accuracy through optimal base station positioning. In\nthis section, we analyze the impact of base station config-\nuration on localization performance. GDOP quantifies how\nthe geometric arrangement of base stations affects position\nestimation accuracy and is calculated as:\nG =\n\n\nx1−xr\nd1\ny1−yr\nd1\nz1−zr\nd1\n1\nx2−xr\nd2\ny2−yr\nd2\nz2−zr\nd2\n1\n\nxn−xr\ndn\nyn−yr\ndn\nzn−zr\ndn\n1\n\n\n(7)\nGDOP =\nq\ntrace((GT G)−1)\n(8)\nLower GDOP values, achieved when a mobile device is\nsurrounded by well-distributed base stations, correspond to\nhigher positioning accuracy, while clustered configurations\nresult in higher GDOP and degraded performance. Our anal-\nysis examines five representative base station arrangements\n(Tetrahedral, Asymmetric, Diamond, Z-Shape, and Clus-\ntered) to demonstrate how geometric configuration directly\nimpacts localization precision, particularly in applications\nrequiring high accuracy such as drone navigation.

This degradation\nis particularly severe in the EuRoC dataset (ratio of 1.82),\nhighlighting the vulnerability of the Clustered configuration\nto challenging conditions.\nE. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GDOP AND SLAM\nPERFORMANCE\nThe bar chart in Figure 13 and 14 presents the average\nGDOP values for each base station configuration across all\nEuRoC MAV dataset sequences and Aerolab respectively,\nproviding direct empirical evidence of how geometric ar-\nrangement affects positioning quality. A correlation between\nGDOP values and SLAM performance across both datasets\nis evident especially for global accuracy. The Tetrahedral\nconfiguration’s superior global accuracy directly corresponds\nto its lowest average GDOP in both datasets. However, the\nfusion with visual data helps mitigate some of the geometric\nlimitations, especially for local trajectory accuracy, result-\ning in smaller percentage differences between configurations\ncompared to pure localization.\nVII. SYSTEM LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE\nENHANCEMENTS\nA fundamental consideration of this work, though inherent to\nToA-based positioning rather than our framework’s design, is\nthe assumption of fixed and precisely known base station po-\nsitions.

Even if we consider only local SLAM and neglect\nglobal positioning requirements, another challenge emerges:\nUnlike traditional SLAM landmarks, which provide rich 3D\nor SE3 (6-DoF) measurements and can self-correct during\noptimization, ToA measurements are scalar and offer only\nradial distance constraints. This fundamental difference cre-\nates observability challenges, as each ToA reading constrains\nthe base station position to a sphere around the UAV. While\nmultiple measurements along a trajectory create intersecting\nspheres that could theoretically pinpoint base station posi-\ntions, in practice ToA measurement accuracy (typically 20-30\ncm) expands each sphere into a thick shell. This measurement\nuncertainty, rather than geometric ambiguity, is what makes\nreliable convergence challenging without accurate initial po-\nsition estimates for both the drone’s pose and base station\npositions. This significantly complicates system initialization\nand contrasts with the current framework, which assumes that\nthe drone’s initial pose is unknown.\nIn practical deployment scenarios, this limitation is mit-\nigated by the nature of indoor 5G infrastructure, which\ntypically involves fixed installations and one-time deploy-\nment. Calibrating base station positions during setup ensures\nconsistent global localization while significantly reducing\nsystem complexity. While some applications may involve\ndynamic or unknown base station positions, maintaining a\nsubset of known positions as global anchors remains essential\nfor establishing a consistent global reference frame. This\ntrade-off between practicality and flexibility enables robust\nglobal SLAM while addressing key challenges associated\nwith scalar ToA measurements.\nBeyond the base station positioning challenges, several\nother limitations affect the system’s real-world applicability.\nThe current ToA simulation framework assumes ideal Line-\nof-Sight (LoS) conditions, while Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)",

CONCLUSION\nThis paper presented a novel approach for integrating 5G\nTime of Arrival (ToA) measurements into ORB-SLAM3,\nenabling globally consistent localization and mapping for\nindoor drone navigation. By extending ORB-SLAM3’s op-\ntimization pipeline to jointly process ToA data alongside\nvisual and inertial measurements, we successfully trans-\nformed inherently local SLAM estimates into globally refer-\nenced trajectories while effectively resolving scale ambiguity\nin monocular configurations. Our comprehensive evaluation\nacross multiple datasets and SLAM configurations demon-\nstrated that ToA integration maintains high local accuracy\nwhile enabling consistent global positioning - a capability\nabsent in traditional SLAM systems. For monocular systems\nspecifically, the integration of ToA measurements success-\nfully addressed the fundamental challenge of scale ambiguity\nwithout requiring additional sensors or manual calibration.\nThe investigation into unknown base station positions re-\nvealed that our approach remains effective even with limited\nknowledge of anchor positions, showcasing the system’s\nadaptability to real-world deployment constraints. Further-\nmore, we demonstrated that ToA measurements can serve as\na viable alternative to traditional loop closure mechanisms,\nmaintaining trajectory consistency in scenarios where loop\ndetection might be unreliable or impossible. Our analysis\nof different geometric arrangements of base stations pro-\nvided valuable insights into optimal deployment strategies,\nrevealing performance differences between configurations.\nThis knowledge directly informs practical implementation by\nguiding base station placement decisions.\nComparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods con-\nfirmed the robustness of our approach even under challenging\noperational constraints such as lower measurement frequen-\ncies and sequential base station operation.
