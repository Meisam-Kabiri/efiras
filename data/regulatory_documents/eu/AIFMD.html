entry into force of a delegated act by the Commission in this regard. It
 is intended that the harmonised regime, during a further transitional

this Directive require AIFMs to ensure compliance with requirements for 
which, in some fund structures, AIFMs are not responsible. An example of
 such fund structures is where the responsibility for appointing the 
depositary rests with the AIF or another entity acting on behalf of the 
AIF. In such cases, the AIFM has no ultimate control over whether a 
depositary is in fact appointed unless the AIF is internally managed. 
Since this Directive does not regulate AIFs, it cannot require an AIF to
 appoint a depositary. In cases of failure of an AIFM to ensure 
compliance with the applicable requirements of an AIF or another entity 
on its behalf, the competent authorities should require the AIFM to take
 the necessary steps to remedy the situation. If, despite such steps, 
the non-compliance persists, and in so far as it concerns an EU AIFM or 
an authorised non-EU AIFM managing an EU AIF, the AIFM should resign as 
manager of that AIF. If the AIFM fails to resign, the competent 
authorities of its home Member State should require such resignation and
 the marketing in the Union of the AIF concerned should no longer be 
permitted. The same prohibition should apply to authorised non-EU AIFMs 
marketing non-EU AIFs in the Union.</p>

provide their competent authorities with relevant information regarding 
the main instruments in which they are trading and on the principal 
exposures and most important concentrations of the AIFs they manage.

this Directive, those smaller AIFMs should be allowed to be treated as 
AIFMs subject to the opt-in procedure provided for by this Directive.

require in all cases AIFMs to implement valuation procedures resulting 
in the proper valuation of assets of AIFs. The process for valuation of 
assets and calculation of the net asset value should be functionally 
independent from the portfolio management and the remuneration policy of
 the AIFM and other measures should ensure that conflicts of interest 
are prevented and that undue influence on the employees is prevented.

therefore cannot at the same time act in the best interest of the AIF as
 is required of a depositary. Depositaries should be able to delegate 
custody tasks to one or more prime brokers or other third parties. In 
addition to the delegated custody tasks prime brokers should be allowed 
to provide prime brokerage services to the AIF. Those prime brokerage 
services should not form part of the delegation arrangement.</p>

 to disclose information regarding the overall level of leverage 
employed, the leverage arising from borrowing of cash or securities and 
the leverage arising from positions held in derivatives, the reuse of 
assets and the main sources of leverage in their AIFs. Information 
gathered by competent authorities should be shared with other

from the rights conferred under this Directive, such as to market units

compliance with this Directive. This should ensure a level playing field
 between EU and non-EU AIFMs. This Directive therefore provides for an 
authorisation applicable to non-EU AIFMs which will become applicable 
after the entry into force of the delegated act adopted by the 
Commission in this regard. To ensure that such compliance is enforced, 
the competent authorities of a Member State should enforce compliance 
with this Directive. For such non-EU AIFMs the competent supervisory 
authorities should be the competent authorities of the Member State of 
reference, as defined in this Directive.</p>

State. Finally, the third country where the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU

 AIFs are marketed on a domestic or cross-border basis. Where a Member 
State allows the marketing of AIFs to retail investors in its territory,
 this possibility should be available regardless of the Member State

 in London, G20 Leaders agreed that hedge funds or their managers should
 be registered and should be required to disclose appropriate 
information on an ongoing basis to supervisors or regulators. They 
should be subject to oversight to ensure that they have adequate risk 
management. In June 2010, G20 Leaders in Toronto reaffirmed their 
commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong
 measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of hedge 
funds in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. In 
order to support the G20 objectives, the International Organization of 
Securities Commissions issued high level principles of hedge fund 
oversight in June 2009 to guide the development of internationally 
consistent regulation in this area. On 16 September 2010 the European 
Council agreed on the need for Europe to promote its interest and values
 more assertively and in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit in 
the context of the Union’s external relations and to take steps to, 
inter alia, secure greater market access for European business and 
deepen regulatory cooperation with major trade partners. The Commission 
will endeavour to ensure that these commitments are implemented in a 
similar way by the Union’s international partners.</p>
