In drawing up these rules, the compliance function must take into account, as far as necessary for the IFM in question, the ethical rules laid down in the internal governance arrangements.

In general, the compliance function must be organised so that it covers all the areas which may result in compliance risks. However, insofar as some areas, resulting in practice in compliance risks, may also be linked to other functions such as the risk control function, accounting function or legal function, and for the sake of avoiding any duplication of the compliance controls, the areas other than those referred to above may not be directly covered by the compliance function. In this case, it is understood that the compliance risk is to be covered by the other internal control functions in accordance with a compliance policy clearly defining the competences and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in this area and subject to compliance with the segregation of duties. In this case, the Compliance Officer within the IFM as referred to in Sub-sections 5.3.2.4. and 5.3.2.5. must assume the role of coordination, centralisation and verification that the other areas which do not directly fall within his/her competence are well covered.",
