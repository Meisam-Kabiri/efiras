Sub-section 5.3.3.3. Specific responsibilities and scope of the internal audit function
270. In general, the internal audit function must review and assess whether the IFMâ€™s central
administration and internal governance arrangements are adequate and operate effectively. In this
respect, the internal audit function must assess, among others:
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
the monitoring of compliance with the laws and regulations and the prudential
requirements imposed by the CSSF;
the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal control;
the adequacy of the IFMâ€™s organisation, including, in particular, the monitoring of
delegates as well as the implementation of the procedure for the approval of new
business relationships and new products;
the adequacy of the accounting and IT function;
the adequacy of the segregation of duties and of the exercise of activities;
the accurate and complete registration of the transactions and the compilation of
accurate, comprehensive, relevant and understandable financial and prudential
information which is available without delay to the management body/governing body,
to specialised committees, where appropriate, and to the senior management and the
CSSF;
the implementation of the decisions taken by the senior management and by the persons
acting by delegation and under their responsibility;
the compliance with the procedures governing capital adequacy as specified in Chapter
3 (Own funds) of this circular;
Circular CSSF 18/698
Page 42/96â€¢
the operation and effectiveness of the compliance and risk management functions.
271. The internal audit must be independent from the other internal control functions which it audits.
Consequently, the risk management function or the compliance function cannot be performed by the
person responsible for the internal audit function of the IFM. However, these functions may take into
account the internal audit work as regards the verification of the correct application of the standards
in force to the exercise of the activities by the IFM.
272. The internal auditor must ensure that the department applies the international standards of the
Institute of Internal Auditors or equivalent international standards.
273. The multi-year internal audit plan must be provided to the CSSF upon request.
Sub-section 5.3.3.4. Person responsible for the permanent internal audit function
274. The IFM must communicate beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person responsible for the
internal audit function supplemented by the following pieces of information and any other document
which might be subsequently indicated by the CSSF:
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
â€¢
a recent curriculum vitae, signed and dated;
a copy of the passport/identity card;
a declaration of honour, as may be downloaded on the CSSF website (www.cssf.lu);
and
a recent extract of the criminal record, if available, or any other equivalent document.
275. In the event of a change of the person responsible for internal audit, the IFM must communicate
beforehand to the CSSF the name of the person succeeding him/her in office supplemented by the
documents referred to in point 274 above.
276. The role of the person responsible for internal audit cannot be ensured by a member of the
management body/governing body of the IFM unless s/he is member of the IFMâ€™s senior
management.
